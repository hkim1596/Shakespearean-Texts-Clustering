            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <head>THE ARGUMENT.</head>
                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>T that time when the States of <hi>Greece</hi> began to grow great, and Philoſophie to be thought precious, <hi>Solon</hi> the firſt light of the Athenian commonswealth, like a provident Bee, gathering honey over many fields, learning knowledge over many Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, was ſent for by <hi>Croeſus</hi> King of Lydia, as famous for his wealth, as the other was for his wiſedome. And not ſo much for any deſire the King had to profit by the experience of ſo profound a Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſopher, as to have the report of his (as he thought it) happineſſe approved by the teſtimonie of ſo renowmed a witneſſe. But <hi>Solon</hi> alwayes like himſelfe, entring the regall Palace, and ſeeing the ſame very gloriouſly apparrelled, but very incommodiouſly furniſhed with Courtiers, more curious to have their bodies deckt with a womaniſhly affected forme of rayment, and ſome ſuperfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall complements of pretended curteſies, then to have their mindes enriched with the true treaſure of ineſtimable vertue, he had the ſame altogether in diſdaine. Therefore after ſome conference had with <hi>Croeſus</hi> concerning the felicitie of man, his opinion not ſeconding the Kings expectation, he was retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with contempt as one of no underſtanding. But yet comforted by <hi>Aeſop</hi> (Author of the witty fables) who for the time was reſident at Courts, and in credit with the King.</p>
                  <p>Immediately after the departure of <hi>Solon, Croeſus</hi> having two Sounes (whereof the eldeſt was dumbe, and the other a brave youth) dreamed that the yongeſt dyed by the wound of a Dart, wherewith being marvellouſly troubled, he married him to a Gentlewoman named <hi>Caelia,</hi> and for farther diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſuſpected, though inevitable deſtinie, he diſcharged the uſing of all ſuch weapons as he had dreamed of. Yet who could cut away the occaſion of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, from accompliſhing that which they had deſign'd. The ſpiritfull youth ing long reſtrain'd from the fields, was invited by ſome Country-men to the chace of a wilde Bore, yet could very hardly impetrate leave of his loving ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picious Father.</p>
                  <p>Now in the meane time there arrived at <hi>Sardis</hi> a youth named <hi>Adraſtus,</hi> Sonne to the King of <hi>Phrygia,</hi> one no leſſe infortunate then valorous, he ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving loſt his Miſtriſſe by a great diſaſter, and having kill'd his brother by a farre greater, came to <hi>Croeſus,</hi> by whom he was courteouſly entertained, and by the inſtancy of the King, and the inſtigation of others againſt his own will, who feared the frowardneſſe of his infectious fortune, he got the cuſtodie of <hi>Atis</hi> (ſo was the Prince called) whom in time of the ſport, thinking to kill the Bore, by a monſtrous miſhap he killed. After which diſaſtrous accident ſtanding above the dead corps, after the inquiry of the truth, being pardoned by <hi>Croeſus,</hi> he puniſhed himſelfe by a violent death. There after, <hi>Croeſus</hi> ſorrowing exceedingly this exceeding misfortune, he was comforted by <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danis,</hi> who laboured to diſſwade him from his unneceſſary journey againſt the <hi>Perſians,</hi> yet he repoſing on ſuperſtitious, and wrong interpreting reſponſes
<pb facs="tcp:7000:6"/>of deceiving Oracles, went againſt <hi>Cyrus,</hi> who having defeated his forces in the field, and taken himſelfe in the Citie, tyed him to a ſtake to be burned, where by the exclayming divers times on the name of <hi>Solon,</hi> moving the Conquerour to compaſsion, he was ſet at libertie, and lamenting the death of his Sonne, and the loſſe of his kingdome, gives a ground for this preſent Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedie.</p>

                           <l>In <hi>Macedonie</hi> was his death contriv'd;</l>
