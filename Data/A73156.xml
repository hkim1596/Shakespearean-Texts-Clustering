            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head type="sub">The humble Petition of the Drapers of the Towne of Shrewsbury.</head>
            <p>WHereas there is a Bill paſſed in the Lower Houſe of Parliament, for the free Trade and Traffique of Welch Cloathes in and through the Kingdome of England and Dominion of Wales, by which the Inhabitants of Wales are enabled freely to ſell by way of Barter or otherwiſe, all their welch Cloathes at their wils and pleaſures, to any perſons who may lawfully buy the ſame; And that any perſons who by the Lawes of this Realme may lawfully buy any ſuch Cloathes, may freely buy the ſame of any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons inhabiting within the ſaid Dominion of Wales; Any Charter, Graunt, Act, Order, or any thing elſe heretofore made or hereafter to bee made to the contrary notwithſtanding; And further giueth certaine liberty to any perſons vſing the Trade of Marchandize, to tranſport the ſaid Cloathes into the parts beyond the Seas, out of any Ports or Hauens of Wales, &amp;c. <hi>vt in billa:</hi> which Bill if it ſhall alſo paſſe this Honorable Houſe: theſe inconueniences would enſue.</p>
            <p>
               <label>1. <hi>To the Towne of Shrewsbury.</hi>
               </label>
               <lb/>
The Clothiers of Wales may ſell their Cloathes by retayle or otherwiſe in <hi>Shrewſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury,</hi> contrary to an auncient Charter of Corporation graunted to the Drapers by <hi>Edward</hi> the 4.th, and confirmed by the Kings Maieſty that now is, and others his Anceſtors: And ſo for this Commodity it doth take away their Priuiledge, and the Priuiledge of all other Corporations of England.</p>
            <p>The Drapers are prohibited by the French Patent to tranſport the ſaid Cloathes into France as formerly they vſed to doe; and ſo if this Act paſſe, will be depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued of their Trade both abroad and at home; Which home-Trade for Welch Cloathes, they haue founded, continued and maintained, euen time out of minde.</p>
            <p>Many poore Sheermen and their Families, to the number of 800. perſons, that liue there by Dreſſing the ſaid Clothes, will be vndone or forced to ſeeke them new dwellings in the fartheſt parts of Wales, where dwellings are ſcarce.</p>
            <p>The Towne in generall wanting its accuſtomed Trade, will bee impoueriſhed and made vnfit to doe his Maieſty ſeruice, as heretofore it hath done.</p>
            <p>
               <label>2. <hi>To the Country of Wales.</hi>
               </label>
               <lb/>
The Marchants tranſporting thence onely at certaine times of the yeare, will ouerthrow the weekely Market at <hi>Oſweſtrey;</hi> Without the which the poore Clothier cannot liue, at which Market the Drapers of <hi>Shrewsbury, Oſweſtrey,</hi> and <hi>Whitchurch,</hi> did beſtow 2000. pounds or thereabouts, euery weeke.</p>
            <p>
               <label>3. <hi>To the King.</hi>
               </label>
               <lb/>
By tranſporting out of thoſe partes and ſelling in diuers Markets; the King will be defrauded of his Cuſtome and Aulnage; or be at a greater charge in receiuing of it, then the profit will amount to.</p>
            <p>
               <label>4. <hi>To the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</hi>
               </label>
               <lb/>
Forraigne partes will be furniſhed by forraigne Marchants, with the better ſort of thoſe Cloathes (which are very vſefull) and at a cheaper rate then our owne Kingdome.</p>
            <p>Vnder colour of tranſporting Cottons out of thoſe creekes, the Marchant will tranſport Rawe hydes, Wooll, Tallow, and other prohibited goods.</p>
            <p>THe Lords of the Priuie Counſell aſwell in the late Queenes time, as in his Maieſties time that now is, haue, vpon graue and mature deliberations and refferences, to diuers Honorable perſonages and graue Iudges, both of England and Wales (who heard the allegations on all partes) made ſeuerall Orders for the ſetling of this Trade; which by this Act will be ouerthrowne.</p>
            <p>It may therefore pleaſe your Honour to haue conſideration of theſe precedent Reaſons, and to lend your Honorable Aſſiſtance for the rectify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the ſaid Bill; for the good of the ſaid Towne and Common-weale.</p>
