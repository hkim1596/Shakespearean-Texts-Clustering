            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>T that time when the ſtates of <hi>Greece</hi> began to growe great, and Philoſophie to be thought pretious, <hi>Solon</hi> the firſt light of the Athenian common-wealth like a proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Bee gathering honnie ouer many fields, learning knowledge ouer many countries, was ſent for by <hi>Croeſus</hi> King of <hi>Lidia</hi> as famous for his Wealth, as the other was for his Wiſedome. And not ſo much for any deſire the King had to profit by the experience of ſo profound a Philoſopher, as to haue the report of his (as he thought it) happines approoued by the testimonie of ſo renoumed a witneſſe. But <hi>Solon</hi> always like himſelfe entring the regall Pallace, and ſeeing the ſame very gloriouſly apparelled, but very incommodiouſlie furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed with Courtiers, more curious to haue their bodies deckt with a woma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhlie affected forme of rayment, and ſome ſuperficiall complements of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended curteſies, then to haue their minds enriched with the true treaſure of ineſtimable vertue, he had the ſame altogether in diſdaine. Therefore after ſome conference had with <hi>Croeſus</hi> concerning the felicitie of man, his opinion not ſeconding the Kings expectation, he was returned with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt as one of no vnderstanding. But yet comforted by <hi>Aeſop</hi> (Authour of the wittie fables) who for the time was reſident at Court, and in credit with the King.</p>
                  <p>Immediately after the departure of <hi>Solon, Croeſus</hi> hauing two Sonnes (whereof the eldeſt was dumbe, and the other a braue youth) dreamd that the yongeſt dyed by the wound of a dart, wherewith being maruellouſly troubled, he maried him to a Gentlewoman named <hi>Caelia,</hi> and for farther diſapointing the ſuspected, though ineuitable destinie, he diſcharged the vſing of all ſuch weapons as he had dreamed of. Yet who could cut away the occaſion from the heauens of accompliſhing that which they had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignd. The ſpiritfull youth being long restraind from the fields, was inuited by ſome countrie-men to the chace of a wild Boare, yet could very hardlie impetrate leaue of his louinglie ſuspitious father.</p>
                  <p>Now in the meane time there arriued at <hi>Sardis</hi> a youth named <hi>Adra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtus,</hi> Sonne to the King of <hi>Phrigia,</hi> one no leſſe infortunate then valourous,
<pb facs="tcp:177:3"/>he hauing loſt his mistreſſe by a great diſaster, and hauing kild his brother by a farre greater, came to <hi>Croeſus,</hi> by whom he was courteouſly enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taind, and by the instancie of the King, and the instigation of others againſt his owne will, who feared the frowardnes of his infectious fortune, he got the custodie of <hi>Atis</hi> (ſo was the Prince called) whom in time of the ſport thinking to kill the Boare, by a monstrous miſhap he killed. After which diſastrous accident ſtanding aboue the dead corps after the inquirie of the truth being pardoned by <hi>Croeſus,</hi> he puniſhed himſelfe by a violent death. There after, <hi>Croeſus</hi> ſorrowing exceedingly this exceeding misfortune, he was comforted by <hi>Sandanis,</hi> who laboured to diſſwade him from his vnne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary iourney againſt the <hi>Perſians,</hi> yet he repoſing on ſuperstitious, and wrong interpreted responſes of deceauing oracles, went againſt <hi>Cyrus,</hi> who hauing defeated his forces in the field, and taken himſelfe in the Citie, tyed him to aſtake to be burned, where by the exclaiming diuers times on the name of <hi>Solon,</hi> mouing the Conquerour to compaſſion, he was ſet at libertie, and lamenting the death of his Sonne, and the loſſe of his Kingdome, makes the Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrophe of this preſent Tragedie.</p>

                        <seg rend="decorInit">D</seg>ARIVS,</hi> the fourteenth from <hi>Cyrus</hi> King of <hi>Perſia,</hi> being after the death of <hi>Occhus</hi> for his ſingular valour from the gouernment of <hi>Armenia</hi> aavanc'd to the <hi>Perſian</hi> empyre, became ſo arrogant (Fortune, as it were, ſetting him forward to confuſion) as he ſent to demand tribute of <hi>Phillip,</hi> then King of <hi>Macedonia:</hi> who being of a hautie nature, and inferiour to none of that age in courage, or mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarie diſcipline, requited this contumelius meſſage with as diſdainfull an anſwere; threatning that he would come and deliuer it in <hi>Perſepolis.</hi> But being preuented by death he left the execution of his deſigne to his ſonne <hi>Alexander,</hi> who for the great victories which thereafter he obtained was ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named the great. He inheriting the hatred of his Father to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Darius,</hi> and far ſurmounting him in ambition, paſt in perſon to <hi>Aſia</hi> with an armie of thirtie thouſand only.</p>
                  <p>After his arriuall, <hi>Darius</hi> wrote to him in a proud and contemptible manner, aſcribing to himſelfe the title of the King of Kings, and kinſman of the Gods, and naming <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi> his ſeruant. Hee alſo in vaunting manner boaſted that he would haue that mad boy, the ſonne <hi>Philip</hi> (for ſo in deriſion he tearmed him) bound, and beaten with rods, and after brought to his preſence apparrelled like a Prince. For performance whereof he directed one of his Minions with fourtie thouſand, to make impediment to his paſſage at the riuer of <hi>Granick;</hi> where by the wonderfull valour of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:177:53"/>they were ouer-throwne. <hi>Darius</hi> being aduertiſed of this, came himſelfe in proper perſon, accompanied with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite, (but euill ordered) nomhers; and encountred <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> beſide <hi>Iſſo,</hi> in the ſtraites of <hi>Cilicia:</hi> where hauing fought a doubtfull and bloody battell, in ende by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible valour, and neuer-fayling Fortune of <hi>Alexander</hi> his armie was defeated, himſelfe put to flight, and his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, wife, and children made captiues. They were moſt cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſlie entertained by <hi>Alexander:</hi> who notwithſtanding their exceeding great beautie yet would not abuſe them, or ſuffer them to be abuſed by others: nor viſited he them more oft then once (and that to comfort them) all the time of their impriſonment.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Darius,</hi> notwithſtanding of all his loſſes (his courage be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the full, whilſt his Fortune was in the waine) wrote very proudly to <hi>Alexander,</hi> taking ſtill the title of a King to himſelfe, but not giuing it him, offering him as much gold, as <hi>Macedon</hi> could containe, for ranſome of the Captiues. Which being very diſdainfully refuſed by <hi>Alexander,</hi> he hauing re-enforced his troupes, &amp; comming forwarder to fight with greater force then before, was enformed how his wife had died in priſon, whoſe death he bewaild with excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding great ſorrowe. And vnderſtanding what courteſie <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander</hi> had vſed towards her, he ſent to ſue for peace, not for any feare of his force, but allured (as he alledged) by his courteſie. This ſute being likewiſe reiected, he fought be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide <hi>Arbella</hi> with no better Fortune then before. Yet for all theſe misfortunes being of an inuincible courage, and diſpay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of peace, he re-aſſembled all his forces, which were aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented by the comming of the <hi>Bactrians,</hi> &amp; was comming forward with intention at laſt either to die, or preuaile. But
<pb facs="tcp:177:53"/>in the meane time two traiterous ſubiects of his owne, to wit, <hi>Beſſus</hi> whom he had promoted to be gouernour of <hi>Bactria,</hi> &amp; <hi>Nabarzanes</hi> one in ſpeciall credite with him, conſpired his death. VVhich danger, though it was reuealed to him by <hi>Patron,</hi> Captaine of the Greekes, yet he could not, or rather would not eſchue. At length, thoſe two traitours tooke and bound him with golden chaines, and caſt him in an olde Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riot, with purpoſe to preſent him to <hi>Alexander.</hi> But they hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring how he would not accept their preſent, and how he was comming to inuade them, threw their darts at <hi>Darius,</hi> and left him for dead. In this eſtate he was found by <hi>Poliſtratus,</hi> and after the deliuery of ſome fewe words dyed. <hi>Alexander</hi> hauing exceedinglie lamented his miſerable and vndeſerued end, directed his bodie to his mother <hi>Siſigambis</hi> to be honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably buried.</p>

                  <head>The Argument.</head>
                  <p>WHen <hi>Alexander</hi> the great, after all his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts (ſhining through the glory of innumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble victories) was returned backe to <hi>Babylon,</hi> where the Ambaſſadours of the whole worlde did attend his comming, as one that was deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied to domineere ouer all: there being admired by the <hi>Grecians,</hi> adored by the <hi>Barbarians,</hi> and as it were drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken with the delights of an extraordinary proſperitie, hee ſuffered himſelf to be tranſported with an inundation of pleaſure; till ſitting at one of his feaſts by the meanes of the ſonnes of <hi>Antipater</hi> his cup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearers, in the beſt, both of his age and fortune, he was ſuddenly poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned.</p>
                  <p>Incontinent after his death, thoſe that were in great eſtimation with himſelfe during his life, and then with the armie, aſsembled themſelues together, neglecting for a long time his funeralls, whilſt buſied about the diſpoſing of his Empire: at laſt (after diuers o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions) it was concluded, that if <hi>Roxane,</hi> the widdow of their deceaſed ſoueraigne (who was then at the point to bee deliuered of her birth) happened to beare a ſonne, hee ſhould ſucceed in his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers place, and till he were come to ſome maturitie of age, <hi>Perdic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cas, Leonatus, Craterus,</hi> and <hi>Antipater</hi> were appointed to bee his Tutors: But the foote-men in a diſdaine, that their aduice was not required, proclaimed <hi>Arideus, Alexanders</hi> baſlard brother
<pb facs="tcp:177:91"/>king, and gaue him a guard, of which <hi>Meleager</hi> procured him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to be made Captaine. At this ſodaine alteration, the horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men being troubled, they following <hi>Perdiccas</hi> pitched their campe without the citie; yet in the end, this tumult being by the eloquence of <hi>Perdiccas</hi> appeaſed, all the captaines re-aſſembled themſelues, and hauing diuided the prouinces, made an agreement, which la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted not long: For ſuch was the vehement ambition of thoſe great men, that with all manner of hoſtilitie, they ſtudied how to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine one another, and firſt of all, <hi>Meleager</hi> after a pretended re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation, (though hauing fled to a Temple for refuge) was ſlaine by the appointment of <hi>Perdiccas,</hi> who after aſpiring to a ſuperio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie ouer the reſt, whilſt he went to warre againſt <hi>Ptolomie</hi> in <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt,</hi> by a ſudden mutinie of his owne ſouldiers was miſerably murdered. Then the onely captaine of his faction that remained aliue, was <hi>Eumenes,</hi> a man ſingularly valorous, who encountering with <hi>Craterus</hi> and <hi>Neoptolemus,</hi> by the death of themſelues defeated their armie, whereby being highly aduanced, he was great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enuied<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and (<hi>Leonatus</hi> hauing lately before dyed in a conflict betwixt him and the <hi>Athenians,</hi>) <hi>Antigonus</hi> in the name of the reſt was ſent againſt him with a great armie, betwixt whom there hauing paſſed diuers skirmiſhes with a variable ſucceſſe, and ſome priuate conference without agreement: In the end, he was betrayed by his owne ſouldiers, and deliuered bound to <hi>Antigonus,</hi> who ſhortly after cauſed him to be put to death.</p>
                  <p>Then <hi>Antigonus</hi> (his riuals in the authoritie being remoued out of his way) did aſpire to that himſelfe, from which he was ſent to ſeclude others, and hauing murdered diuers of the gouernors, hee diſpoſed of their Prouinces as hee pleaſed: whereof <hi>Caſſander, Ptolomie,</hi> and <hi>Liſimachus,</hi> aduertiſed by <hi>Seleucus,</hi> who fled for feare of incrring the like danger; they entred all together in a league againſt <hi>Antigonus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now at this time <hi>Olimpias</hi> plagued all the faction of <hi>Caſſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:177:91"/>in <hi>Macedonie,</hi> hauing cauſed <hi>Arideus</hi> and his Queene <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridice</hi> to be put to death; by which, and other cruelties (hauing loſt the fauour of the people) ſhee was conſtrained, when <hi>Caſſander</hi> came againſt her, to retire herſelfe within a Towne; which (by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the ſcarcitie of victuals) not being able to defend, ſhee ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, together with her ſelfe to <hi>Caſſander,</hi> by whom (notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of his promiſe to the contrary) ſhe was publikely put to death, and ſo hauing proceeded ſo farre in wickednes, he thought it no time to retire till he had extinguiſhed all his maſters race; hee cauſed <hi>Roxane</hi> and her ſonne to bee murdered; and ſoone after, <hi>Hercules, Alexanders</hi> baſtard ſonne, which multitude of mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, gaue to him the crowne of <hi>Macedone;</hi> and to me, the Subiect of this Politragicke Tragedie.</p>
