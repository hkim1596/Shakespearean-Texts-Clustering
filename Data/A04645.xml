            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

If Noble, all her Kindred will be your Tyrannes. If fruitfull, as proud as <hi>May,</hi> and humorous as <hi>April;</hi> ſhe muſt haue her Doctors, her Mid-wiues, her Nurſes, her longings euerie houre: though it be for the deareſt morſell of man.

If preciſe, you muſt feaſt all the ſilenc'd Brethren, once in three dayes; ſalute the Siſters; entertayne the whole Family, or Wood of 'hem; and heare long-winded Exerciſes, Singings, and Catechiſings, which you are not giuen to, and yet muſt giue for: to pleaſe the zealous Matron your Wife, who, for the holy cauſe, will coſen you, ouer and aboue.

O my felicity! how I ſhall bee reueng'd on mine inſolent Kinſman, and his plots to fright mee from marrying! This night I will get an Heire, and thruſt him out of my bloud like a Stranger; hee would bee knighted, forſooth, and thought by that meanes to raigne ouer mee, his Title muſt doe it: no Kinſman, I will now make you
<pb facs="tcp:13668:19"/>bring me the tenth Lords, and the ſixteenth Ladies Letter, Kinſman; and it ſhall doe you no good, Kinſman. Your Knight-hood it ſelfe ſhall come on it's knees, and it ſhall bee reiected; it ſhall bee ſued for it's fees to execution, and not be redeem'd; it ſhall cheat at the twelue-peny Ordinary, it Knight-hood, for it's Dyet all the Terme-time, and tell Tales for it in the Vacation, to the Hoſteſſe: or it Knight-hood ſhall doe worſe; take Sanctuary in <hi>Cole-harbor,</hi> and faſt. It ſhall fright all it friends, with borrowing Letters, and when one of the foure-ſcore hath brought it Knight-hood tenne ſhillings, it Knight-hood ſhall go to the <hi>Cranes,</hi> or the <hi>Beare</hi> at the <hi>Bridge</hi>-foot, and be drunke in feare: it ſhall not haue money to diſcharge one Tauerne reckoning, to inuite the old Creditors, to forbeare it Knight-hood; or the new, that ſhould bee, to truſt it Knight-hood. It ſhall bee the tenth name in the Bond, to take vp the commodity of Pipkins and ſtone Iugs; and the part thereof ſhall not furniſh it Knight-hood forth, for the attempting of a Bakers Widdow, a brown Bakers Widdow. It ſhall giue it Knight-hoods name, for a <hi>ſtallion,</hi> to all gameſome Citizens Wiues, and bee refus'd; when the Maſter of a Dauncing Schoole, or (<hi>How</hi> doe you call him) the worſt Reueller in the Towne is taken: it ſhall want Clothes, and by reaſon of that, wit, to foole to Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers. It ſhall not haue hope to repaire it ſelfe by <hi>Constanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople, Ireland,</hi> or <hi>Virginia;</hi> but the beſt, and laſt fortune to it Knight-hood ſhall bee, to make <hi>Dol Teare-ſheet,</hi> or <hi>Kate-Common,</hi> a Lady: and ſo, it Knight-hood may eate.</p>

You muſt approch them i' their owne height, their owne line: for the contrary makes many that feare to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit themſelues to noble and worthy fellowes, runne into the imbraces of a Raſcall. If ſhe loue Wit, giue Verſes, though you borrow 'hem of a friend, or buy 'hem, to haue good. If Valour, talke of your Sword, and be frequent in the menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Quarrels, though you be ſtaunch in fighting. If actiuity be ſeen o'your <hi>Barbary</hi> often, or leaping ouer ſtooles, for the credit of your back. If ſhe loue good clothes or dreſſing haue your learned Counſel about you euery morning, your <hi>French</hi> Taylor, Barber, Linnener, &amp;c. Let your Poulder, your Glaſſe, and your Combe, be your deareſt acquaintance. Take more care for the ornament of your head, then the ſafetie: and wiſh the Common-wealth rather troubled, then a haire about you. That will take her. Then if ſhee bee couetous and crauing, doe you promiſe any thing, and performe ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringly: ſo ſhall you keepe her in appetite ſtill. Seeme as you would giue, but be like a barren field that yeelds little, or vnlucky Dice, to fooliſh, and hoping Gameſters. Let your gifts be flight, and daintie, ra her then precious. Let cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning be aboue coſt. Giue Cherries at time of yeere, or Apri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cots; and ſay they were ſent you out of the Countrey, though you bought 'hem in <hi>Cheap-ſiae.</hi> Admire her Tyres; like her in all faſhions; compare her in euery habit to ſome Deitie; inuent excellent Dreames to flatter her, and Riddles; or, if ſhee bee a great one, performe alwayes the ſecond
<pb facs="tcp:13668:29"/>parts to her: like what ſhe likes, prayſe whom ſhee prayſes, and faile not to make the Houſhold and Seruants yours, yea the whole Family, and ſalute 'hem by their names: ('tis but light coſt if you can purchaſe' hem ſo) and make her Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian your Penſioner, and her chiefe woman. Nor will it bee out of your gaine to make loue to her too, ſo ſhe follow, not vſher, her Ladies pleaſure. All blabbing is taken away, when ſhe comes to be a part of the crime.</p>

I loue not your Diſpurations, or your Court-tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mults. And that it be not ſtrange to you, I will tell you. My Father, in my education, was woont to aduiſe mee, that I ſhould alwayes collect, and contayne my mind, not ſuffring
<pb facs="tcp:13668:45"/>it to flow looſely; that I ſhould looke to what things were neceſſarie to the carriage of my life, and what not: embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing the one and eſchewing the other. In ſhort, that I ſhould endeare my ſelfe to reſt, and auoid turmoile: which now is growne to bee another nature to mee. So that I come not to your publike pleadings, or your places of noyſe; not that I neglect thoſe things, that make for the dignitie of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth: but for the meere auoyding of clamours, and impertinences of Orators, that know not how to bee ſilent. Aud for the cauſe of noyſe, am I now a ſutor to you You doe not know in what a miſerie I haue beene exercis'd this day, what a torrent of euill! My very Houſe turnes round with the tumult! I dwell in a Wind-mill! The perpetuall about motion is here, and not at <hi>Eltham.</hi>
