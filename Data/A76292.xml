            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <l>And had their equall life: Vices which were</l>

            <l>Be't to your praiſe too, that your Stock and veine</l>

            <l>So piercing (where you pleas'd) hitting a fault,</l>
            <l>That humours from your Pen iſſued all ſalt.</l>
            <l>Nor were you thus in works and Poems knit,</l>

            <l>Both joy'nd, and both did wholly make the Play:</l>
            <l>For that you could write ſingly, we may gueſſe</l>

            <l>The other into ſhape, nor did one ſtick</l>
            <l>The others cold Inventions with ſuch wit,</l>
            <l>As ſerv'd like ſpice, to make them quick and fit;</l>
            <l>Nor out of mutuall want, or emptineſſe,</l>
            <l>Did you conſpire to go ſtill Twins to th' Preſſe:</l>
            <l>But what thus joyned you wrote, might have come forth</l>
            <l>As good from each, and ſtor'd with the ſame worth</l>
            <l>That thus united them, you did joyne ſenſe;</l>
            <l>In you 'twas League, in others Impotence;</l>

            <l>Such as would bow the hearts of Gods above.</l>
            <l>Thou <hi>Venus</hi> our great Citheraean Queene,</l>
            <l>That hourely trip'ſt on the Idalian greene;</l>
            <l>Thou laughing <hi>Ericina</hi> daigne to ſee</l>
            <l>Theſe verſes wholly conſecrate to thee:</l>
            <l>Temper them ſo within thy Paphian ſhrine,</l>
            <l>That every lovers eye may melt a line;</l>
            <l>Command the god of love, that little king,</l>
            <l>To give each verſe a ſleight touch with his wing;</l>
            <l>That as I write, one line may draw the other,</l>
            <l>And every word skip nimbly o're another.</l>
            <l>There was a lovely Boy the Nymphs had kept,</l>
            <l>That on th' Idalian Mountaines oft had ſlept,</l>
            <l>Begot and born by pow'rs that dwelt above,</l>
            <l>By learned <hi>Mercury</hi> on the Queen of love.</l>
            <l>A face he had that ſhew'd his Parents fame,</l>
            <l>And from them both conjoyn'd he drew his name;</l>
            <l>So wondrous faire he was, that (as they ſay)</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Diana</hi> being bunting on a day,</l>
            <l>
               <pb facs="tcp:169479:10"/>She ſaw the Boy upon a green banke lay him,</l>
            <l>And there the virgin huntreſſe meant to ſlay him;</l>
            <l>Becauſe no Nimphs would now purſue the chace,</l>
            <l>For all were ſtruck blind with the wantons face.</l>
            <l>But when that beauteous face <hi>Diana</hi> ſaw,</l>
            <l>Her armes were nummed, and ſhe could not draw,</l>
            <l>Yet did ſhe ſtrive to ſhoot, but all in vaine,</l>
            <l>She bent her bow, but loos'd it ſtraight againe:</l>
            <l>Then ſhe began to chide her wanton eye,</l>
            <l>And faine would ſhoot, but durſt not ſee him dye:</l>
            <l>She turn'd and ſhot, but did of purpoſe miſſe him,</l>
            <l>She turn'd againe and could not chooſe but kiſſe him;</l>
            <l>Then the Boy ran: for ſome ſay had he ſtaid,</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Diana</hi> had no longer been a maid:</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Phoebus</hi> ſo doted on this roſiat face,</l>
            <l>That he hath oft ſtoln cloſly from his place,</l>
            <l>When he did lie by faire <hi>Leucothoes</hi> ſide,</l>
            <l>To dally with him in the vales of Ide.</l>
            <l>And ever ſince this lovely boy did dye,</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Phoebus</hi> each day about the world doth flye,</l>
            <l>And on the earth he ſeeks him all the day,</l>
            <l>And every night he ſeeks him in the ſea:</l>
            <l>His cheeks were ſanguine, and his lips were red,</l>
            <l>As are the bluſhing leaves of the Roſe ſpread;</l>
            <l>And I have heard that till this Boy was born,</l>
            <l>Roſes grew white upon the virgine thorn;</l>
            <l>'Till one day walking to a pleaſant ſpring,</l>
            <l>To heare how cunningly the birds could ſing,</l>
            <l>Laying him down upon a flowry bed,</l>
            <l>The Roſes bluſh't and turn'd themſelves to red:</l>
            <l>The roſe that bluſh't, not for his great offence,</l>
            <l>The gods did puniſh, and for's impudence</l>
            <l>They gave this doome, and 'twas agreed by all,</l>
            <l>The ſmell of the white roſe ſhould be but ſmall.</l>
            <l>
               <pb facs="tcp:169479:10"/>His haire was buſhie, bur it was not long,</l>
            <l>The Nimphs had alone his treſſes mighty wrong;</l>
            <l>For as it grew they pull'd away his haire,</l>
            <l>And made habiliments of gold to weare:</l>
            <l>His eyes were <hi>Cupids,</hi> for untill his birth</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Cupid</hi> had eyes, and liv'd upon the earth;</l>
            <l>Till on a day when the great Queen of love</l>
            <l>Was by her white doves drawn from heaven above,</l>
            <l>Unto the top of the Idalian hill,</l>
            <l>To ſee how well the Nymphs her charge fulfill,</l>
            <l>And whether they had done the goddeſſe right</l>
            <l>In nurſing of her ſweet <hi>Hermaphrodite;</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Whom when ſhe ſaw, (although compleat and full)</l>
            <l>Yet ſhe complain'd his eyes were ſomewhat dull:</l>
            <l>And therefore more the wanton boy to grace,</l>
            <l>She pull'd the ſparkling eyes from <hi>Cupid's</hi> face,</l>
            <l>Faining a cauſe to take away his ſight,</l>
            <l>Becauſe the Ape would ſometimes ſhoot for ſpight:</l>
            <l>But <hi>Venus</hi> ſet thoſe eyes in ſuch a place,</l>
            <l>As grac'd thoſe cleare eyes with a clearer face;</l>
            <l>For his white hand each goddeſſe did him wooe,</l>
            <l>For it was whiter than the driven ſnow;</l>
            <l>His leg was ſtraighter than the thigh of <hi>Jove,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>And he far fairer than the god of love.</l>
            <l>When firſt this well ſhap'd boy, beauties chiefe king,</l>
            <l>Had ſeen the labour of the fifteenth ſpring,</l>
            <l>How curiouſly it painted all the earth,</l>
            <l>He 'gan to travell from his place of birth,</l>
            <l>Leaving the ſtately hils where he was nurſt,</l>
            <l>And where the Nymphs had brought him up at firſt;</l>
            <l>He lov'd to travell unto coaſts unknown,</l>
            <l>To ſee the Regions far beyond his own,</l>
            <l>Seeking cleare watry ſprings to bath him in,</l>
            <l>For he did love to waſh his Ivory skin.</l>
            <l>
               <pb facs="tcp:169479:11"/>The lovely Nymphs have oft times ſeen him ſwim,</l>
            <l>And cloſely ſtoln his cloaths from off the brim,</l>
            <l>Becauſe the wanton wenches would ſo faine</l>
            <l>See him come nak'd to aske his cloaths againe;</l>
            <l>He lov'd beſides to ſee the Lician grounds,</l>
            <l>And know the wealthy Carians utmoſt bounds.</l>
            <l>Uſing to travell thus, one day he found</l>
            <l>A Chriſtall brook that tril'd along the ground;</l>
            <l>A brook that in reflection did ſurpaſſe</l>
            <l>The cleare reflection of the cleareſt glaſſe;</l>
            <l>About the ſide there grew no foggy reeds,</l>
            <l>Nor was the front compaſt with barren weeds,</l>
            <l>But living turfe grew all along the ſide,</l>
            <l>And graſſe that ever flouriſh'd in his pride;</l>
            <l>Within this brook a beautious Nymph did dwell,</l>
            <l>Who for her comely feature did excell;</l>
            <l>So faire ſhe was, of ſuch a pleaſing grace,</l>
            <l>So ſtraight a body, and ſo ſweet a face,</l>
            <l>So ſoft a belly, ſuch a luſty thigh,</l>
            <l>So large a forehead, ſuch a criſtall eye,</l>
            <l>So ſoft and moiſt a hand, ſo ſmooth a breſt,</l>
            <l>So faire a cheek, ſo well in all the reſt:</l>
            <l>That <hi>Jupiter</hi> would revell in her bower</l>
            <l>Were he to ſpend again his golden ſhower.</l>
            <l>Her teeth were whiter than the Morning-milk,</l>
            <l>Her lips were ſofter than the ſofteſt ſilk,</l>
            <l>Her haire as far ſurpaſt the burniſh'd gold,</l>
            <l>As ſilver doth excell the baſeſt mold;</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Jove</hi> courted her for her tranſluent eye,</l>
            <l>And told her he would place her in the skie;</l>
            <l>Promiſing her if ſhe would be his love,</l>
            <l>He would ingrave her in the heavens above:</l>
            <l>Telling this lovely Nymph, that if he would,</l>
            <l>He could deceive her in a ſhower of gold;</l>
            <l>
               <pb facs="tcp:169479:11"/>Or like a ſwan come to her naked bed,</l>
            <l>And ſo deceive her of her Maidenhead.</l>
            <l>But yet becauſe he thought that pleaſure beſt</l>
            <l>Where each conſenting joines each loving breſt,</l>
            <l>He would put off that all commanding crowne,</l>
            <l>Whoſe terrour ſtroke th' aſpiring Giants down;</l>
            <l>That glitt'ring crown whoſe radiant fight did toſſe</l>
            <l>Great <hi>Pelion</hi> from the top of mighty Oſſe:</l>
            <l>He would depoſe from his world-ſwaying head</l>
            <l>To taſte the amarous pleaſure of her bed;</l>
            <l>This added, he beſides the more to grace her,</l>
            <l>Like a bright ſtar he would in heaven's vault place her.</l>
            <l>By this the proud laſcivious Nymph was mov'd,</l>
            <l>Perceiving that by great <hi>Iove</hi> ſhe was lov'd:</l>
            <l>And hoping as a ſtar ſhe ſhould e're long</l>
            <l>Be ſtern or gracious to the ſea-man's ſong,</l>
            <l>(For mortals ſtill are ſubject to the eye,</l>
            <l>And what it ſees they ſtrive to get as high)</l>
            <l>She was contented that almighty <hi>Iove</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Should have the firſt and beſt fruits of her love;</l>
            <l>For women may be likned to the yeare,</l>
            <l>Whoſe firſt fruits ſtill do make the daintieſt cheare.</l>
            <l>But yet <hi>Aſtraea</hi> firſt ſhould plight her troath,</l>
            <l>For the performance of <hi>Ioves</hi> ſacred oath;</l>
            <l>Juſt times decline, and all good daies are dead,</l>
            <l>When heavenly oaths had need be warranted.</l>
            <l>This heard great <hi>Iupiter</hi> and lik'd it well,</l>
            <l>And haſtily he ſeeks <hi>Aſtraeas</hi> cell,</l>
            <l>About the maſſie earth ſearching her tower;</l>
            <l>But ſhe had long ſince left this earthly bower,</l>
            <l>And flew to heaven above, loathing to ſee</l>
            <l>The ſinfull actions of humanity:</l>
            <l>Which when <hi>Iove</hi> did perceive, he left the earth,</l>
            <l>And flew up to the place of his own birth;</l>
            <l>
               <pb facs="tcp:169479:12"/>The burning heavenly throne, where he did ſpy</l>

            <l>This ſtately tower was builded up on high,</l>
            <l>Far from the reach of any mortall eye;</l>
            <l>And from the Pallace ſide there did diſtill</l>
            <l>A little water through a little quill,</l>
            <l>The dew of juſtice which did ſeldom fall,</l>
            <l>And when it dropt, the drops were very ſmall:</l>
            <l>Glad was great <hi>Iove,</hi> when he beheld her tower,</l>
            <l>Meaning a while to reſt him in her bower;</l>
            <l>And therefore ſought to enter at her doore,</l>

            <l>Some ſlipt again betwixt him and the doore;</l>
            <l>At length (with much adoe) he paſt them all,</l>

            <l>Each mortall man ſhould the great god diſgrace,</l>

            <l>
               <hi>Jove</hi> heard the words and 'gan to make his moane,</l>

            <l>Her heavenly ſweets her moſt delicious kiſſes,</l>
            <l>Her ſoft embraces, and the amorous nights,</l>
            <l>That he ſhould often ſpend in her delights,</l>
            <l>He would be quite thrown down by mortall hands</l>
            <l>From the bleſt place where his bright pallace ſtands:</l>
            <l>But afterwards he ſaw with better ſight,</l>
            <l>He ſhould be ſcorn'd by every mortall wight,</l>
            <l>If he ſhould want his thunderbolts to beat</l>
            <l>Aſpiring mortals from his glittering ſeat;</l>
            <l>Therefore the god no more did woe or move her,</l>
            <l>But left to ſeeke her love, though not to love her:</l>
            <l>Yet he forgot not that he woo'd the Laſſe,</l>
            <l>But made her twice as beautious as ſhe was,</l>
            <l>Becauſe his wonted love he needs would ſhew.</l>

            <l>Of Gods, and make them for her love deſpaire,</l>
            <l>I do not know, but ſure the maid was faire:</l>

            <l>It is reported that her fellows us'd</l>

            <l>And put her lazie idleneſſe apart.</l>

            <l>And as ſhe went it made her looſe haire curle:</l>
            <l>Oft in the water did ſhe ſee her face,</l>
            <l>And oft ſhe us'd to practice what quaint grace</l>
            <l>Might well become her, and what comly feature</l>
            <l>Might be beſt fitting ſo divine a creature.</l>
            <l>Her skin was with a thin vaile over-thrown,</l>
            <l>Through which her naked beauty clearly ſhone;</l>

            <l>Sometimes ſhe doth her beautious front entwine;</l>
            <l>But ſhe was gathering flow'rs with her white hand,</l>

            <l>I ſaid, her armes were crooked, fingers bent,</l>
            <l>Her ſhoulders bow'd, her legs conſum'd and ſpent:</l>
            <l>Her colour ſad, her neck as darke as night,</l>
            <l>(When <hi>Venus</hi> might in all have tane delight,)</l>
            <l>But yet becauſe I would no more come nigh her,</l>
            <l>My ſelfe unto my ſelfe did thus belye her.</l>
            <l>Do thou the like, and though ſhe faire appeare,</l>
            <l>Thinke, vice to vertue often comes too neere;</l>
            <l>And in that errour (though it be an errour)</l>
            <l>Preſerve thy ſelfe from further terrour.</l>

            <l>If brown, ſay black, and think who cares for that;</l>
            <l>If ſhe be ſlender, ſweare ſhe is too leane,</l>
            <l>That ſuch a Wench will weare a man out cleane;</l>
            <l>If ſhe be red, ſay, ſhee's too full of bloud;</l>
            <l>If pale, her body nor her mind is good;</l>
            <l>If wanton, ſay, ſhe ſeeks thee to devoure;</l>
            <l>If grave, neglect her, ſay, ſhe looks too ſowre.</l>
            <l>
               <pb facs="tcp:169479:26"/>Nay, if ſhe have a fault, and thou doſt know it,</l>
            <l>Praiſe it, that in thy preſence ſhe may ſhew it:</l>

            <l>Take any way to eaſe thy own diſtreſſe,</l>

            <l>For that which Taylors make, a fine neat Doublet.</l>
            <l>And men are even as mad in their deſiring,</l>
            <l>That oftentimes love Women for their tyring;</l>
            <l>He that doth ſo, let him take this adviſe,</l>
            <l>Let him riſe early, and not being nice,</l>
            <l>Up to his Miſtris chamber let him hie,</l>
            <l>E're ſhe ariſe, and there he ſhall eſpie</l>
            <l>Such a confuſion of diſordered things,</l>
            <l>In Bodies, Jewels, Tyres, Wyres, Lawnes, and Rings,</l>
            <l>That ſure it cannot chooſe but much abhor him,</l>
            <l>To ſee her lye in peeces thus before him;</l>
            <l>And find thoſe things ſhut in a painted box</l>
            <l>For which he loves her, and endures her mocks.</l>
            <l>Once I my ſelfe had a great mind to ſee</l>
            <l>What kind of things Women undreſſed be,</l>
            <l>
               <pb facs="tcp:169479:27"/>And found my Sweet-heart, juſt when I came at her,</l>
            <l>Screwing in teeth, and dipping rags in water.</l>
            <l>She miſs'd her Perriwig, and durſt not ſtay,</l>
            <l>But put it on in haſte the backward way;</l>
            <l>That had I not on th' ſudden chang'd my mind,</l>
            <l>I had miſtooke and kiſs'd my Love behind.</l>
            <l>So, if thou wiſh her faults ſhould rid thy cares,</l>
            <l>Watch out thy time, and take her unawares:</l>
            <l>Or rather put the better way in proofe,</l>
            <l>Come thou not neere, but keep thy ſelfe aloofe.</l>
            <l>If all this ſerve not, uſe one medicine more,</l>
            <l>Seek out another Love, and her adore;</l>
            <l>But chuſe out one, in whom thou well maieſt ſee</l>
            <l>A heart inclin'd to love and cheriſh thee.</l>
            <l>For as a River parted ſlower goes,</l>
            <l>So, Love thus parted ſtill more evenly flowes.</l>
            <l>One Anchor will not ſerve a Veſſell tall,</l>
            <l>Nor is one hooke enough to fiſh withall,</l>
            <l>He that can ſolace him, and ſport with two,</l>
            <l>May in the end triumph as others do.</l>
            <l>Thou that to one haſt ſhew'd thy ſelfe too kind,</l>
            <l>Maieſt in a ſecond much more comfort find:</l>
            <l>If one Love entertaine thee with deſpight,</l>
            <l>The other will embrace thee with delight:</l>
            <l>When by the former thou art made accurſt,</l>
            <l>The ſecond will contend t' excell the firſt,</l>
            <l>And ſtrive, with love, to drive her from thy breaſt:</l>
            <l>("That firſt to ſecond yields, women know beſt.)</l>
            <l>Or if to yeeld to either thou art loath,</l>
            <l>This may perhaps acquit them of them both.</l>
            <l>For what one Love makes odde, two ſhall make even,</l>
            <l>Thus blows with blows, and fire by fire's out driven.</l>
            <l>Perchance this courſe will turne thy firſt Loves heart,</l>
            <l>And when thine is at eaſe cauſe hers to ſmart.</l>

            <l>Yet from the others love ſhe'l ſtrive to move thee:</l>
            <l>But let her ſtrive, ſhe oft hath vex'd thy heart,</l>

            <l>Thy ſelfe as well as thou didſt faigne to be.</l>
            <l>So have I often, when I would not drink,</l>
            <l>Sate down as one aſleep and faign'd to wink,</l>

               <l>SLeep not too much, nor longer than aſleep</l>
               <l>Within thy bed thy lazie body keep;</l>
               <l>For when thou warme awake ſhalt feele it ſoft</l>
               <l>Fond cogitations will aſſaile thee oft:</l>
               <l>Then ſtart up early, ſtudy, worke, or write,</l>
               <l>Let labour (others toyle) be thy delight.</l>
               <l>Eate not too much, for if thou much doſt eat</l>
               <l>Let it not be dainty or ſtirring meat:</l>
               <l>Abſtaine from Wine although thou thinke it good,</l>
               <l>It ſets thy meat on fire, and ſtirs thy bloud;</l>
               <l>Uſe thy ſelfe much to bath thy wanton limbs,</l>
               <l>In cooleſt ſtreams, which o're the gravell ſwims:</l>
               <l>Be ſtill in graveſt company, and flye</l>
               <l>The wanton rabble of the younger fry,</l>
               <l>Whoſe luſtfull tricks will lead thee to delight,</l>
               <l>To thinke on love, where thou ſhalt periſh quit;</l>
               <l>Come not at all where many women are,</l>
               <l>But like a Bird that lately ſcap'd the ſnare,</l>
               <l>Avoyd their gariſh beauty flye with ſpeed,</l>
               <l>And learne by her that lately made thee bleed;</l>
               <l>Be not too much alone, but if alone</l>
               <l>Get thee ſome modeſt booke to looke upon;</l>
               <l>But do not read the lines of wanton men,</l>
               <l>Poetry ſets thy mind on fire agen:</l>
               <l>Abſtaine from Songs and Verſes, and take heed</l>
               <l>That not a line of love thou ever read.</l>

            <l>My pock-hole face, they ſay, appear'd to ſome</l>

            <l>My tongue did ſwim in Ale, and joy'd to boaſt</l>
            <l>It ſelfe a greater Seaman than the toaſt;</l>
            <l>My mouth was grown awry, as if it were</l>

            <l>My guts were mines of ſulphur, and my ſet</l>

            <l>Nay, when I piſt, my Urine was ſo hot,</l>
            <l>It burnt a hole quite through the chamber-pot:</l>
            <l>Each Brewer that I met I kiſsd, and made</l>
            <l>Suit to be bound Apprentice to the Trade:</l>
            <l>

            <l>That my own legs could my Indentures draw.</l>
            <l>Well Sir, I grew ſtarke mad, as you may ſee</l>
            <l>By this adventure upon Poetry.</l>
            <l>You eaſily may gueſſe, I am not quite</l>
