            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>Who? Miſtris <hi>Stichwell,</hi> by this light I know her not.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Cuffe.</speaker>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Cuffe.</speaker>
               <p>I thought ſo, why its the <hi>Semſter,</hi> one that both you had beene vndone had it not beene for her, but what talke you of vndoing? I ſay Miſter is <hi>Stichwell</hi> the <hi>Semſter</hi> was the very maker of you both, yet thus little doe you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard her, but it is the common cuſtome of you all, when you come to bee ſo great as you are, you forget from what houſe you come.</p>

               <p>Well <hi>Band</hi> and <hi>Ruffe,</hi> you were beſt both of you to take heede of her, you knowe ſhee ſet you both in the Stocks once before, and if ſhee catch you againe, it is a hundreth to
<pb facs="tcp:4670:5"/>one, if ſhe hang you not both vp, for ſhe hath got ſtrings already.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ruffe.</speaker>

               <speaker>Cuffe.</speaker>
               <p>Since you will goe, goe; but heare me, if you goe, looke at me well; as little a fellow as I am, I will come and <hi>Cuffe</hi> you both out of the fields; if I doe not, ſay, <hi>Cuffe</hi> is no man of his hands.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>

               <p>Alas poore ſhrimpe, thou art nothing in my hands.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>

               <p>If you goe, you ſhall neuer ſay that <hi>Cuffe</hi> came of a ſleeueleſſe errand, Ile binde your hands (I warrant you) for ſtriking.</p>
            </sp>

               <p>And you bee ſo chollericke, Ile euen pinne you both in, as ſoone as I come home: can you not decide the quarrell betweene your ſelues without a field? I had thought you had beene a little more milde, <hi>Ruffe.</hi> You were a horrible <hi>Puritane</hi> the other day, a very preciſe <hi>Ruffe.</hi>
               </p>

               <p>Friends with him? ſuch a baſe Raſcall? he is a very threed-bare fellow, I ſcorne, but my man <hi>Coller</hi> ſhould goe as well as hee euery day in the weeke, and be friends with him.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Cuffe.</speaker>
               <p>Nay, ſurely he is his Maſter, at leaſt his Maker: for <hi>Bands,</hi> make rags; Rags make Paper; Paper makes Paſt-board; and Paſt-board makes <hi>Collar;</hi> and I thinke that this is a ſtiffe argument that he is his Maſter.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ruffe.</speaker>
               <p>Well, be he what he will, if I catch his <hi>Collar,</hi> Ile cut him in iags, let mee but claſpe him, and Ile make him for ſtirring.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Cuffe.</speaker>
               <p>But you ſhall not fight: haue you not Friends &amp; Neighbours enough to end this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouerſie, but you muſt goe into the fields, and there cut the threed of your liues? wee'l haue none of that, come chooſe you an Vmpire, <hi>Band,</hi> for it ſhall be ſo.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Band.</speaker>
               <p>Since you will force me to it, if <hi>Ruffe</hi> be content, I am willing.</p>
