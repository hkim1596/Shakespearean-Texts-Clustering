            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>¶ To the reuerende Diuines, vnto <hi>whom theſe Poſies ſhall happen to be</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented, George Gaſcoigne Eſquire (profeſsing armes in the defence of Gods truth) wiſheth quiet in conſcience, and all conſolation in Chriſt Ieſus.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">R</seg>Ight reuerend: I haue thought it my part (before I vvade further in publiſhing of theſe Poſies) to lay open before your graue iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes, aſvvell the cauſe vvhich preſently moueth mee to preſent them, as alſo the depth and ſecrets of ſome conceytes, vvhich (being paſſed in clovvdes and figuratiue ſpeeches) might per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſe both be offenſiue to your grauitie, and perillous to my credite.</p>
            <p>It is verie neare tvvo yeares paſt, ſince (I beeing in Hollande in ſeruice vvith the vertuous Prince of O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renge) the moſt parte of theſe Poſies vvere imprinted, and novv at my returne, I find that ſome of them haue not onely bene offenſiue for ſundrie vvanton ſpeeches and laſciuious phraſes, but further I heare that the ſame haue beene doubtfully conſtrued, and (therefore) ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous.</p>
            <p>My reuerende and vvelbeloued: vvhatſoeuer my youth hath ſeemed vnto the grauer ſort, I vvoulde bee verie loth novve in my middle age to deſerue reproch: more loth to touch the credite of any other, and moſte loth to haue mine ovvn name become vnto you odious.
<pb facs="tcp:3023:3"/> For if I ſhoulde novve at this age ſeeme as careleſſe of reproche, as I vvas in greene youth readie to goe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtray, my faultes might quickely grovve double, and myne eſtimation ſhoulde bee vvoorthie too re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayne but ſingle. I haue learned that although there may bee founde in a Gentleman vvhereby to be repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended or rebuked, yet ought he not to be vvoorthie of reproofe or condemnation.</p>
            <p>All this I ſet dovvne in preamble, too the ende I maye thereby purchaſe youre pacience. And as I deſyre that you vvyll not condemne mee vvyth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oute proofe, ſo am I contented, that if heereafter you finde mee guiltie, youre definitiue, ſentence ſhall then paſſe publikelye vnder the Seale of Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueritie.</p>
            <p>It vvere not reaſon (righte reuerende) that I ſhoulde bee ignoraunt hovve generally vvee are all <hi>magis proni ad malum quàm ad bonum.</hi> Euen ſo is it requiſite that I acknovvledge a generall reformation of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners more neceſſarie to bee taught, than anye VVhet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone of Vanities is meete (in theſe dayes) to bee ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered. And therefore as youre grauitie hathe thought requyſite that all ydle Bookes or vvanton Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlettes ſhoulde bee forbidden, ſo might it ſeeme that I vvere vvoorthie of greate reprehenſion, if I ſhoulde bee the Aucthour of euill vvilfully, or a prouoker of vyces vvittingly. And yet ſome there are vvho haue not ſpared too reporte that I receyued greate ſummes of money for the firſt printing of theſe Poſies, vvhere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by (if it vvere true) I mighte ſeeme not onely a craf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
<pb facs="tcp:3023:3"/> Broker for the vtteraunce of gariſhe toyes, but a corrupte Merchaunte for the ſale of deceyptfull vvares.</p>
            <p>For anſvvere heereof it is moſte true (and I call Heauen and Earth too vvitneſſe) that I neuer recey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued of the Printer, or of anye other, one grote or pennie for the firſte Copyes of theſe Poſyes. True it is that I vvas not vnvvillinge the ſame ſhoulde bee imprinted: And that not of a vaineglorious de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſyre too bee thought a pleaſaunt Poet, neyther yet of a lyghte minde too bee counted a cunning Louer. For though in youth I vvas often ouerhardie too put my name in Ballaunce of doubtfull iudgementes, yet novve I am become ſo baſhfull that I coulde rather bee content too leeſe the prayſe of my follyes, than too hazarde the miſconceyte of the graue and graye headed Iudges. But too confeſſe a truthe vntoo you right reuerende (vvith vvhome I maye not diſſemble in caſes vvhiche ſo generally doe touche all menne) I vvas the rather contented too ſee them imprinted for theſe ſundrie conſiderations.</p>
            <p>Firſt, for that I haue ſeene dyuerſe Authours, (both learned and vvell learned) vvhich after they haue both reformed their liues, and conuerted their ſtudies, haue not yet diſdeyned to reade the Poems vvhich they let paſſe their pennes in youth. For it ſeemeth vntoo mee that in all ages Poetrie hath beene not onely per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, but alſo it hath beene thought a right good and excellent qualitie.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:3023:4"/>
            <p>Next vnto this, I haue alvvayes bene of opinion, that it is not vnpoſsible eyther in Poemes or in Proſe too vvrite both compendiouſly, and perfectly in our Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhe tongue. And therefore although I chalenge not vnto my ſelfe the name of an Engliſh Poet, yet may the Reader finde oute in my vvrytings, that I haue more faulted in keeping the olde Engliſh vvordes <hi>(quamuis iam obſoleta)</hi> than in borovving of other languages, ſuch Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thetes and Adiectiues as ſmell of the Ink horne.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, as I ſeeke aduauncement by vertue, ſo vvas I deſirous that there might remaine in publike recorde, ſome pledge or token of thoſe giftes vvhervvith it hath pleaſed the Almightie to endue me: To the ende that thereby the vertuous might bee incouraged to employ my penne in ſome exerciſe vvhich might tende both to my preferment, and to the profite of my Countrey. For many a man vvhich may like mine outvvarde pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, might yet haue doubted vvhether the qualityes of my minde had bene correſpondent to the proportion of my bodie.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, bicauſe I had vvritte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſundry things vvhich coulde not chuſe but content the learned and Godlye Reader, therefore I hoped the ſame ſhould ſerue as vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted proofe, that I had layde aſide vanities, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted to exerciſe my penne in morall diſcourſes, at leaſt the one paſsing (cheeke by cheek) vvith the other, muſte of neceſsitie perſuade both the learned, and the light minded, that I coulde aſvvell ſovve good graine, as graynes or draffe. And I thought not meete (beeing intermingled as they vvere) to caſt avvay a vvhole bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhell of good ſeede, for tvvo or three graynes of Darnell
<pb facs="tcp:3023:4"/> or Cockle.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, I perſuaded my ſelfe that as in the better ſort of the ſame I ſhoulde purchaſe good lyking vvith the honourable aged: So euen in the vvorſt ſorte, I might yet ſerue as a myrrour for vnbrydled youth, to auoyde thoſe perilles vvhich I had paſſed. For little may he do vvhich hath eſcaped the rock or the ſandes, if he cannot vvaft vvith his hande to them that come after him.</p>
            <p>Theſe conſideration<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> (right reuerend) did firſt moue me to conſent that theſe Poemes ſhoulde paſſe in print. For recapitulation vvhereof, and to anſvvere vnto the obiections that may bee giuen: I ſay to the firſt that I neither take example of wanton Ouid, doting Nigidius, nor fooliſh Samocratius. But I delight to thinke that the reuerend father Theodore Beza, vvhoſe life is vvor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily become a lanterne to the vvhole vvorlde, did not yet diſdaine too ſuffer the continued publication of ſuch Poemes as he vvrote in youth. And as he termed them at laſt <hi>Poëmata castrata,</hi> So ſhal your reuerend iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments beholde in this ſeconde edition, my Poemes gel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded from all filthie phraſes, corrected in all erronious places, and beautified vvith addition of many moral ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples.</p>
            <p>To the ſeconde, although I be ſometimes conſtrey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned for the cadence of rimes, or <hi>per licentiam Poeticam,</hi> to vſe an ynkehorne terme, or a ſtraunge vvord: Yet hope I that it ſhall be apparant I haue rather regarde to make our natiue language commendable in it ſelfe, than gay vvith the feathers of ſtraunge birdes.</p>
            <p>To the thirde reaſon may be obiected, that if I vvere ſo deſirous to haue my capacitie knovvne, I ſhoulde
<pb facs="tcp:3023:5"/> haue done much better to haue trauelled in ſome notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous peece of vvorke, vvhich might generally haue ſpred my commendation. The vvhich I confeſſe. But yet is it true that I muſt take the Foord as I finde it: Sometimes not as I vvoulde, but as I may And ſince the ouerſight of my youth had brought mee farre behinde hande and indebted vnto the vvorld, I thought good in the meane time to pay as much as I had, vntill it might pleaſe God better to inable me. For commonly the greedieſt credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor is appeaſed, if he ſee his debitor vvilling to pay vvhe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he hath any thing. And therefore being buſied in mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall affayres (vvhereby alſo I ſought ſome aduaunce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) I thought good to notifie vnto the vvorlde be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore my returne, that I coulde as vvell perſuade vvith Penne, as pearce vvith launce or vveapon: So that yet ſome noble minde might be incouraged both to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe me in time of peace, and to emploie mee in time of ſeruice in vvarre.</p>
            <p>To the fourth and laſt conſiderations, I had alled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged of late by a right reuerende father, that although in deede out of euerie floure the induſtrious Bee may ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther honie, yet by proofe the Spider thereout alſo ſucks miſcheeuous poyſon. VVherevnto I can none other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vviſe anſvvere, but that he vvho vvill throvv a ſtone at euerie Dogge vvhich barketh, had neede of a great ſat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chell or pocket. And if the learned iudgements and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt mindes doe both conſtrue my doings aright, and take therein either councell or commoditie, then care I the leſſe vvhat the vvicked conceyue of my conceytes. For I eſteeme more the prayſe of one learned Reader, than I regard the curious carping of ten thouſande vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lettered
<pb facs="tcp:3023:5"/> lettered tattlers.</p>
            <p>To conclude (right reuerend) as theſe conſiderations did ſpecially moue me at firſt to conſent to the imprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of theſe poſies, ſo novve haue I yet a further conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration vvhich moueth mee moſt earneſtly to ſue for this ſecond edition or publiſhing of the ſame. And that is this. I vnderſtande that ſundrie vvell diſpoſed mindes haue taken offence at certaine vvanton vvordes and ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences paſſed in the fable of <hi>Ferdinando Ieronimi,</hi> and the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die <hi>Elinora de Valaſco,</hi> the vvhich in the firſt edition vvas ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med The aduentures of maſter F. I. And that alſo ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvith ſome buſie coniectures haue preſumed to thinke that the ſame vvas indeed vvritten to the ſcandalizing of ſome vvorthie perſonages, vvhom they vvoulde ſeeme therby to knovv. Surely (right reuerend) I ſmile to ſee the ſimplicitie of ſuch, vvho being indeed ſtarke ſtaring blind, vvould yet ſeeme to ſee farre into a milſtone. And the rather I ſcorne their raſh iudgements, for that in tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king vvith .xx. of them one after another, there haue not tvvo agreed in one coniecture. Alas, alas, if I had bene ſo fooliſhe as to haue paſſed in recitall a thing ſo done in deede, yet all the vvorld might thinke me verie ſimple if I vvoulde call Iohn, Iohn, or Mary, Mary. But for the better ſatiſfying of all men vniuerſally, I doe here pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt vnto you (reuerend) euen by the hope of my ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that there is no liuing creature touched or to be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted therby. And for the reſt you ſhall find it novv in this ſecond imprinting ſo turquened and turned, ſo clenſed from all vnclenly vvordes, and ſo purged from the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor of inhumanitie, as percaſe you vvoulde not iudge that it vvas the ſame tale. For although I haue bin here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore
<pb facs="tcp:3023:6"/> contented to ſuffer the publication thereof, only to the ende men might ſee my Methode and maner of vvriting, yet am I novve thus deſirous to ſet it forth eft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoones, to the ende all men might ſee the reformation of my minde. And that all ſuſpitions may be ſuppreſſed and throughly ſatiſfied, by this mine vnfeined proteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion vvhich I make vnto you in that behalfe. Finally, vvere it not that the ſame is alreadie extant in ſuch ſort as hath moued offence, I ſhould rather be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tent to can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel it vtterly to obliuion, then thus to returne it in a nevv patched cote. And for full proofe of mine earneſt zeale in Gods ſeruice, I require of you (reuerende) moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly, that if hereby my skill ſeeme ſufficient to vvade in matters of greater importance, you vvill then vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafe to employ mee accordingly. Surely you ſhall finde me no leſſe readie to vndertake a vvhole yeares trauaile in anie vvorke vvhich you ſhall thinke me able to ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, than I haue beene vvilling heretofore to ſpende three houres in penning of an amorous Sonnet. Euen ſo being deſirous that all men generally (and you eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially) ſhould conceiue of me as I meane, I haue thus farre troubled your lerned eies vvith this plaine Epiſtle, vvritten for my purgation, in matters vvhiche (elſe) might both haue offended you, and giuen great batterie to the ramparts of my poore credite. The God of peace vouchſafe to gouerne and product you, and me, and all his, in quiet of conſcience, and ſtrength of ſpirit. Amen.

            <head>To al yong Gentlemen, and general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>to the youth of England, George</hi> Gaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coigne Eſquire by birth, and Souldiour by profeſsion, wiſheth increaſe of knowledge in all vertuous exerciſes.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>Allant Gentlemen, and luſtie youthes of this my natiue Countrey, I haue here (as you ſee) publiſhed in print ſuche Poſies and rymes as I vſed in my youth, the which for the barbarouſneſſe of the ſtile may ſeeme worthleſſe, and yet for the doubtfulneſſe of ſome darke places they haue alſo ſeemed (heretofore) dau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gerous. So that men may iuſtly both condemne me of raſhneſſe, and wonder at my ſimplicitie in ſuffering or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing the ſame to be imprinted.</p>
            <p>A yong man well borne, tenderly foſtered, and delicately ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied, ſhall hardly paſſe ouer his youth without falling into ſome ſnares of the Diuell, and temptations of the fleſh. But a man of middle yeares, who hath to his coſt experimented the vanities of youth, and to his perill paſſed them: who hath bought repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance deare, and yet gone through vvith the bargaine: who ſeeth before his face the tyme paſt loſt, and the reſt paſsing away in poſt: Such a man had more neede to be well aduiſed in his doings, and reſolute in his determinations. For with more eaſe and greater fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour may we anſwere for tenne madde follies committed in grene youth, than one ſober ouerſight eſcaped in yeares of diſcretion. <hi>Lycurgus</hi> the good princely Philoſopher, ordeyned that if an olde man perceiuing a yong man to commit any diſhoneſtie; did not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke but ſuffer him: the aged ſhoulde be chaſtiſed, and the yong man ſhould be abſolued.</p>
            <p>All this rehearſed and conſidered, you may (as I ſay) growe in ſome doubt, whether I were worſe occupied in firſt deuiſing, or at laſt in publiſhing theſe toies &amp; pamphlets: and much the rather, for
<pb facs="tcp:3023:7"/> that it is a thing commonly ſeene, that (nowe adayes) fewe or no things are ſo well handled, but they ſhall bee carped at by curious Readers, nor almoſt any thing ſo well ment, but may bee muche miſconſtrued.</p>
            <p>And heerewithall I aſſure my ſelfe, that I ſhall bee generally condemned as a man verie lightly bent, and rather deſyrous to continue in the freſhe remembraunce of my follyes, than con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent too cancell them in obliuion by diſcontinuance: eſpecially ſince in a houſe where many yong childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> are, it hath bene thought better pollicie quite to quench out the fire, than to leaue any loofe cole in the imbers, wherewith Babes may play and put the whole edifice in daunger.</p>
            <p>But my luſtie youthes, and gallant Gentlemen, I had an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent farre contrarie vntoo all theſe ſuppoſes, when I fyrſt permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted the publication heereof. And bycauſe the greateſt of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence that hath beene taken thereat, is, leaſt your mindes might heereby become enuenomed with vanities, therefore vnto you I will addreſſe my tale, for the better ſatisfying of common iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. And vnto you I will explane, that which being before miſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally couered, and commonly miſconſtrued, might be no leſſe pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rillous in ſeducing you, than greeuous euidence for to proue mee guiltie of condemnation.</p>
            <p>Then to come vnto the matter, there are three ſortes of men which (beeing wonderfully offended at this booke) haue founde therein three maner of matters (ſay they) verie reprehenſible. The men are theſe: curious Carpers, ignorant Readers, and graue Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers. The faults they finde are, <hi>Iudicare</hi> in the Creede: Chalke for Cheeſe: and the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon infection of Loue. Of theſe three ſorts of men and matters, I do but very little eſteeme the two firſt. But I deeply regarde the thirde. For of a verie troth, there are one kinde of people nowadayes which will miſlyke any thing, being bred (as I thinke) of the ſpawne of a Crab or Creuiſh, which in all ſtreames and waters will ſwimme eyther ſidewayes, or flat backwards: and when they can indeede finde none other fault, will yet thinke <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicare</hi> verie vntowardlye placed in the Creede. Or (beeing a ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple Sowter) will finde fault at the ſhape of the legge: or if they be
<pb facs="tcp:3023:7"/> not there ſtopped, they wil not ſpare to ſtep vp higher, and ſay, that <hi>Apelles</hi> paynted Dame <hi>Venus</hi> verie deformed or euill fauoured.</p>
            <p>Of this ſort I make ſmall accounte, bycauſe indeede they ſeeke a knotte in the Ruſhe, and woulde ſeeme to ſee verie farre in a Mylſtone.</p>
            <p>There are alſo certaine others, who (hauing no skill at all) will yet be verie buſie in reading all that may bee read, and thinke it ſufficient if (Parrot like) they can rehearſe things without booke: when within booke they vnderſtande neyther the meaning of the Authour, nor the ſenſe of the figuratiue ſpeeches, I will forbeare to recyte examples by any of mine owne doings. Since all compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſons are odious, I will not ſay how much the areignment and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uorce of a Louer (being written in ieaſt) haue bene miſtaken in ſad earneſt. It ſhall ſuffice that the contentions paſſed in verſe long ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thence, betwene maiſter <hi>Churchyard</hi> and <hi>Camell,</hi> were (by a block<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>headed reader) co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtrued to be indeed a quarell betwene two neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors. Of whom that one hauing a Camell in keping, and that other hauing charge of the Churchyard, it was ſuppoſed they had grown to debate, bicauſe the Camell came into the Churchyarde. Laugh not at this (luſtie yonkers) ſince the pleaſant dittie of the noble Erle of Surrey (beginning thus: <hi>In winters iuſt returne</hi>) was alſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrued to be made indeed by a Shepeherd. VVhat ſhoulde I ſtande much in reherſall how the <hi>L. Vaux</hi> his dittie (beginning thus: <hi>I loth that I did loue</hi>) was thought by ſome to be made vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his death bed? and that the Soulknill of M. Edwards was alſo written in extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of ſickneſſe? Of a truth (my good gallants) there are ſuch as ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing only lerned to read Engliſh, do interpret Latin, Greke, French and Italian phraſes or metaphors, eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> according to their owne mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly conception and childiſh skill. The which (bicauſe they take Chalke for Cheeſe) ſhall neuer trouble me, whatſoeuer fault they finde in my doings.</p>
            <p>But the third ſort (beeing graue Philoſophers, and finding iuſt fault in my doings at the common infection of loue) I muſt needes alledge ſuche iuſte excuſe as may counteruayle their iuſte com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>playnts. For elſe I ſhoulde remayne woorthie of a ſeuere puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. They wyſely conſidering that wee are all in youth
<pb facs="tcp:3023:8"/> more apt to delight in harmefull pleaſures, then to diſgeſt whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome and ſounde aduice, haue thought meete to forbid the publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing of any ryming tryfles which may ſerue as whetſtones to ſhar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen youth vnto vanities.</p>
            <p>And for this cauſe, finding by experience alſo, how the firſt Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie of theſe my Poſies hath beene verie much inquired for by the yonger ſort: and hearing likewiſe that (in the ſame) the greater part hath beene written in purſute of amorous enterpryſes, they haue iuſtly conceyued that the continuance thereof hath beene more likely to ſtirre in all yong Readers a venemous deſire of va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie, than to ſerue as a common myrrour of greene and youthfull imperfections. VVherevnto I muſt confeſſe, that as the induſtrious Bee may gather honie out of the moſt ſtinking weede, ſo the mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Spider may alſo gather poyſon out of the fayreſt floure that growes.</p>
            <p>And yet in all this diſcourſe I ſee not proued, that either that Gardener is too blame which planteth his Garden full of fragrant floures neyther that planter to be diſprayſed: which ſoweth all his beddes with ſeedes of wholeſome herbes: neyther is that Orchard vnfruitfull, which (vnder ſhow of ſundrie weedes) hath medicina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble playſters for all infirmities. But if the Chirurgian which ſhould ſeeke Sorrell to rypen an Vlcer, will take Rewe which may more inflame the Impoſtume, then is hee more to blame that miſtooke his gathering, than the Gardener which planted aright, and preſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſtore and choyſe to be taken. Or if the Phiſition will gather hote Perceley in ſtead of cold Endiue, ſhall he not worthily beare the burthen of his owne blame?</p>
            <p>To ſpeake Engliſh, it is your vſing (my luſtie Gallants) or miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vſing of theſe Poſies that may make me prayſed or diſprayſed for publiſhing of the ſame. For if you (where you may learne to auoyd the ſubtile ſandes of wanton deſire) will runne vpon the rockes of vnlawfull luſt, then great is your folly, and greater will growe my rebuke. If you (where you might gather wholeſome hearbes to cure your ſundrie infirmities) will ſpende the whole day in gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of ſweete ſmelling Poſies, much will be the time that you ſhal miſpende, and much more the harme that you ſhall heape vpon my
<pb facs="tcp:3023:8"/> heade. Or if you will rather bebliſter your handes with a Nettle, then comfort your ſenſes by ſmelling to the pleaſant Marioram, then wanton is your paſtime, and ſmall will be your profite.</p>
            <p>I haue here preſented you with three ſundrie ſortes of Poſies: <hi>Floures, Hearbes,</hi> and <hi>VVeedes.</hi> In which diuiſion I haue not ment that onely the floures are to bee ſmelled vnto, nor that onely the VVeedes are to be reiected. I terme ſome Floures, bycauſe being indeed inuented vpon a verie light occaſion, they haue yet in them (in my iudgement) ſome rare inuention and Methode before not commonly vſed. And therefore (beeing more pleaſant than profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table) I haue named them Floures.</p>
            <p>The ſeconde (being indeede morall diſcourſes, and reformed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uentions, and therefore more profitable than pleaſant) I haue na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Hearbes.</p>
            <p>The third (being VVeedes) might ſeeme to ſome iudgements, neither pleaſant nor yet profitable, and therefore meete to bee caſt away. But as many weedes are right medicinable, ſo may you find in this none ſo vile or ſtinking, but that it hath in it ſome vertue if it be rightly handled. Mary you muſt take heede how you vſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. For if you delight to put Hemlocke in your fellowes pottage, you may chaunce both to poyſon him, and bring your ſelfe in perill. But if you take example by the harmes of others who haue eaten it before you, then may you chaunce to become ſo warie, that you will looke aduiſedly on all the Perceley that you gather, leaſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the ſame one braunch of Hemlock might anoy you.</p>
            <p>I aſſure you, my yong blouds, I haue not publiſhed the ſame to the intent that other men hereafter might be infected with my follies forepaſſed. For though it be a comfort <hi>in miſerijs habere conſortem,</hi> yet is it ſmall conſolation to a fellon, to haue a Coyner hanged in his companie. And I aſſure you (although you will think it ſtraunge) that I haue not cauſed them to bee imprinted for anie vaine delight which I haue (my ſelfe) therein conceyued. For the moſt of them being written in my madneſſe, might haue yeelded then more delight to my frantike fanſie to ſee them publiſhed, than they now do accumulate cares in my minde to ſet them forth cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected: and a deformed youth had bene more likely to ſet them to
<pb facs="tcp:3023:9"/> ſale long ſithence, than a reformed man can be able now to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect them with ſimplicitie.</p>
            <p>The ſcope of mine intent, and the marke whereat I ſhoote is double. I meane grounded vpon two ſundrie cauſes: the one that being indebted vnto the worlde (at the leaſt fiue thouſande dayes verie vainly ſpent) I may yeeld him yet ſome part of mine account in theſe Poemes. VVherein as he may finde great diuerſitie both in ſtile and ſenſe, ſo may the good bee incouraged to ſet mee on worke at laſt, though it were noone before I ſought ſeruice. The other reaſon is, that bicauſe I haue (to mine owne great detriment) miſpent my golden time, I may ſerue as enſample to the youthfull Gentlemen of England, that they runne not vpon the rocks which haue brought me to ſhipwracke. Beware therefore, luſtie Gallants, howe you ſmell to theſe Poſies. And learne you to vſe the talent which I haue highly abuſed. Make me your myrrour. And if here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after you ſee me recouer mine eſtate, or reedifie the decayed walls of my youth, then beginne you ſooner to builde ſome foundation which may beautifie your Pallace. If you ſee me ſinke in diſtreſſes (notwithſtanding that you iudge me quick of capacitie) then lerne you to mainteyne your ſelues ſwimming in proſperitie, and eſchue betymes the whirlepoole of miſgouernment.</p>
            <p>Finally, I beſeech you, and coniure you, that you rather encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage me to accompliſh ſome worthier trauaile, by ſeeing theſe Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies right ſmelled vnto, than diſcourage me from attempting other labours, when I ſhall ſee theſe firſt fruites reiected or miſuſed. I haue corrected them from ſundrie faultes. VVhich if they had not brought ſuſpition in the firſt copie, be you then out of doubt you had neuer bene troubled with theſe ſeconde preſents, nor perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to flouriſhe wiſely with a two edged ſwoorde in your naked hands. But as I haue ment them well, ſo I craue of God, that they may both pleaſure and profite you for the furtherance of your skill in any commendable enterpriſe.</p>

            <head>To the Readers generally a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall <hi>aduertiſement of the</hi> Authour.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Ll that is written is written for our inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as the holy Apoſtle witneſſeth to the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines in his .xv. Chapter. And in his ninth Chapter of his firſt Epiſtle to the Corinthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, hee glorieth that hee coulde (as it were) transforme himſelf into all profeſsions, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to winne all kinde of men to God: ſaying that with the Iewes he became a Iew: with them that were vnder the law, he ſeemed alſo vnder the lawe: with the feeble, he ſhewed himſelfe feeble. And to conclude, he became all things to all men, to the ende that hee might thereby winne ſome to ſaluation. My Schoolemaſter which taught me Grammer, woulde alwayes ſay that ſome ſchollers he woonne to ſtudie by ſtrypes, ſome other by fayre meanes, ſome by promiſes, ſome other by prayſes, ſome by vainglorie, and ſome by verie ſhame. But I neuer hard him repent him that euer he had perſuaded any ſcholler to become ſtudious, in what ſort ſoeuer it were that hee woonne him. For whether the braue Gennet be broken with the bitte, or with the ſnaffle, whither he be brought in awe with a Spurre, or with a wand, all is one if he proue readie and well mouthed.</p>
            <p>Thus much I write (gentle Reader) to the ende that myne in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent may appeare in publiſhing of theſe Poſies. VVherein as there are many things morall, ſo are there alſo ſome verſes more ſauced with wantonneſſe than with wiſedome. And as there are ſome dit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties which may pleaſe and delight the godly and grauer ſort, ſo are there ſome which may allure the yonger ſort vnto fond attempts. But what for that? Hath <hi>Terence</hi> bene forbidden to be read, bicauſe his Comedies are rehearſals of many madde prankes played by wanton youthes? No ſurely.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Paracelſus,</hi> and ſundrie other Phiſitions and Philoſophers, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare, that in euerie thing naturall there is to be founde Salt, Oyle,
<pb facs="tcp:3023:10"/> and Brimſtone. And I am of opinion, that in euery thing which is written (the holy ſcriptures excepted) there are to be founde wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, follie, emulation, and detraction. For as I neuer yet ſaw a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing ſo clerkly handled, but that therein might be found ſome imperfections: So coulde I neuer yet reade fable ſo ridiculous but that therein ſome morallitie might be gathered. And as the good writer ſhall be ſure of ſome to bee maliced: ſo the bad ſhall neuer eſcape the byting tongues of ſlaunderers.</p>
            <p>But to returne to my purpoſe: If in the hardeſt flint there may be found ſparkes of liuely fire, and the moſt knottie peece of Box, may be wrought to a fayre Doogen hafte: let theſe fewe ſuffice to perſuade thee, that I haue not procured the publication heereof to any ende, ſo much as that the youthful ſort might therein take ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, and the aged recreation.</p>
            <p>Nowe if any (miſgouerning their owne wittes) doe fortune to vſe that for a Spurre, which I had heere appoynted for a Brydle, I can none otherwiſe lame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t it, but to ſay that I am not the firſt which hath bene miſiudged. Truely (gentle Reader) I proteſt that I haue not ment heerein to diſpleaſe any man, but my deſire hath rather bene to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tent moſt men: I meane the diuine with godly Hymnes and Pſalmes, the ſober minde with morall diſcourſes, and the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt will with ſufficient warning. The which if it ſo fall out, then ſhall I thinke my ſelfe right happie. And if it fall out otherwiſe, I ſhall yet neuer bee aſhamed to become one of their corporation which reape floutes and reprehenſion for their trauayles.</p>
            <p>But bicauſe theſe Poſies growe to a great bundell, and thereof alſo the number of louing lynes exceedeth in the Superlatiue, I thought good to aduertiſe thee, that the moſt part of them were written for other men. And out of all doubt, if euer I wrote lyne for my ſelfe in cauſes of loue, I haue written tenne for other men in layes of luſt. For I counte greater difference betweene loue and luſt, than there is diuerſitie betweene witte and wiſedome: and yet witte and I did (in youth) make ſuch a fray, that I feare his coſen wiſedome will neuer become freendes with me in my age. VVell, though my folly bee greater than my fortune, yet ouergreat were mine vnconſtancie, if (in mine owne behalfe) I ſhoulde compyle ſo
<pb facs="tcp:3023:10"/> many ſundrie Songs or Sonets. I haue heard of an honeſt plaine meaning Citizen, who (being ouercharged with many matters in the lawe, and hearing of a common ſolicitor of cauſes in the Citie) came home to comfort his wife, and tolde hir that he had heard of one which dwelt at Billingſgate, that coulde helpe all men. Eu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n ſo (good Reader) I was a great while the man which dwelt at Bil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingſgate. For in wanton delightes I helped all men, though in ſad earneſt I neuer furthered my ſelfe any kinde of way. And by that it proceedeth, that I haue ſo often chaunged my Poſie or worde. For when I did compile any thing at the requeſt of other men, if I had ſubſcribed the ſame with mine owne vſuall mot or deuiſe, it might haue bewrayed the ſame to haue beene of my doing. And I was euer curious in that behalfe, as one that was lothe to bewray the follies of other men. And yet (as you ſee) I am not verie daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous to lay my ſelfe wide open in view of the worlde. I haue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo ſundrie tymes chaunged mine owne worde or deuiſe. And no meruaile: For he that wandereth much in thoſe wilderneſſes, ſhall ſeldome continue long in one minde.</p>
            <p>VVell, it were follie to bewayle things which are vnpoſsible to be recouered, ſithence Had I wiſt doth ſeldome ſerue as a blaſone of good vnderſtanding. And therefore I will ſpende no more wordes in this Preface, but I pray thee to ſmell vnto theſe Poſies, as <hi>Floures to comfort, Herbes to cure,</hi> and <hi>VVeedes to be auoyded.</hi> So haue I ment them, and ſo I beſeech thee Reader to accept them.</p>

                     <head>¶ In truſt is Treaſon, written by a Louer, leaning onelye to his Ladies promiſes, and finding them to fayle.</head>
                     <l>THe ſtraighteſt Trée that growes vpon one onely roote:</l>
                     <l>If that roote fayle, wyll quickly fade, no props can do it boote.</l>
                     <l>I am that fading plant, which on thy grace dyd growe,</l>

                     <l>I am the ſhip my ſelfe, mine Ancor was thy faith:</l>
                     <l>Which now is fled, thy promiſe broke, &amp; I am driuen to death.</l>
                     <l>Who climeth oft on hie, and truſts the rotten bowe:</l>
                     <l>If that bow breake may catch a fall, ſuch ſtate ſtand I in now.</l>
                     <l>Me thought I was a loft, and yet my ſeate full ſure:</l>

                     <l>For fanſie hath ſuch force, it ouerfloweth all,</l>

<pb n="9" facs="tcp:3023:104"/> betwéene his diet and mine. I neuer ſo much as ſippe of the wine that he taſteth, I féede at the bordes ende with browne bread: Marie I reach always to his owne diſhe, for there are no more but that only on the table. Yet he thinks that for one ſuch dinner I am bound to do him al the ſeruice that I can, and thinks me ſufficiently rewarded for all my trauell, with one ſuche feſtiuall promotion. And yet perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture ſome men thinke I haue great gaines vnder him: but I may ſay and ſweare, that this doſen yéere I haue not gayned ſo muche in value as the points at my hoſe (whiche are but thrée with codpéece poynt and al): he thinkes that I may féede vpon his fauour and faire wordes: but if I could not otherwiſe prouide for one, <hi>Paſiphilo</hi> were in a wyſe caſe. <hi>Paſiphilo</hi> hath mo paſtures to paſſe in than one, I war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant you: I am of houſholde with this ſcholer <hi>Eroſtrato,</hi> (his riuale) as well as with <hi>Domine Cleander:</hi> nowe with the one, and then with the other, according as I ſée their Caters prouide good chéere at the market: and I finde the meanes ſo to handle the matter, that I am welcome too bothe. If the one ſée me talke with the other, I make him beleeue it is to harken newes in the furtherance of his cauſe: and thus I become a broker on bothe ſides. Well, lette them bothe apply the matter as well as they can, for in déede I will trauell for none of them bothe: yet will I ſéeme to worke wonders on eche hande. But is not this one of <hi>Damons</hi> ſeruants that commeth foorth? it is: of him I ſhall vnderſtand where his maſter is. Whither goeth this ioyly gallant?</p>

But alas, I find that only loue is vnſaciable: for as the flie play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth with the flame till at laſt ſhe is cauſe of hir owne decay, ſo the louer that thinketh with kiſſing and colling to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent his vnbrideled apetite, is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly ſeene the only cauſe of his owne conſumption.

I haue free liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie at al times to behold my deſired, to talke with hir, to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace hir, yea (be it ſpoken in ſecrete) to lie with hir. I reape the fruites of my deſire: yet as my ioyes abounde, euen ſo
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:3023:105"/> my paines encreaſe. I fare like the couetous man, that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing all the world at will, is neuer yet content: the more I haue, the more I deſire. Alas, what wretched eſtate haue I brought my ſelfe vnto, if in the ende of all my farre fetches, ſhe be giuen by hir father to this olde doting doctor, this bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard, this bribing villaine, that by ſo many meanes ſeeketh to obtain hir at hir fathers ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds? I know ſhe loueth me beſt of all others, but what may that preuaile when perforce ſhe ſhalbe co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtrained to marie another? Alas, the pleaſant taſt of my ſugred ioyes doth yet remaine ſo perfect in my reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                              <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance, that the leaſt ſoppe of ſorow ſéemeth more ſoure tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> gal in my mouth. If I had neuer knowen delight, with bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter contentatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> might I haue paſſed theſe dreadful dolours. And if this olde <hi>Mumpſimus</hi> (whom the pockes conſume) ſhould win hir, then may I ſay, farewell the pleaſant talke, the kind embracings, yea farewel the ſight of my <hi>Polyneſtat</hi> for he like a ielouſe wretch will pen hir vp, that I thinke the birdes of the aire ſhall not winne the ſighte of hir. I ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped to haue caſte a blocke in his waie, by the meanes that my ſeruaunt (who is ſuppoſed to be <hi>Eroſtrato,</hi> and with my habite and credite is wel eſtéemed) ſhould proffer himſelf a ſuter, at the leaſt to counteruaile the doctors proffers. But my maiſter knowing the wealth of the one, and doubting the ſtate of the other, is determined to be fed no longer with faire wordes, but to accept the doctor, (whom he right well knoweth) for his ſonne in law. Wel, my ſeruant promiſed me yeſterday to deuiſe yet againe ſome newe conſpiracie to driue maiſter doctor out of conceite, and to laye a ſnare that the foxe himſelfe might be caughte in: what it is, I knowe not, nor I ſaw him not ſince he went about it: I will goe ſée if he be within, that at leaſt if he helpe me not, be maye yet prolong my life for this once.

The lawes are ordeyned, and officers appoynted to miniſter iuſtice for the redreſſe of wrongs: and if to the poteſtates I complayne me, I ſhall publiſhe mine owne reproche to the worlde. Yea, what ſhould it preuayle me to vſe all the puiniſhments that can be deuiſed? the thing once done can not be vndone. My daughter is defloured, and I vtterly diſhoneſted: how can I then wype that blot off my browe? and on whome ſhall I ſéeke reuenge? Alas, alas I my ſelfe haue bene the cauſe of all theſe cares, and haue deſerued to beare the puniſhment of all theſe miſhappes. Alas, I ſhould not haue committed my deareſt darling in cuſtodie to ſo careleſſe a creaſure as this olde Nurſe: for we ſee by common proofe, that theſe olde women be either péeuiſhe, or pitifull: either eaſily enclined to euill, or quickly corrupted with bribes and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards. O wife, my good wife (that nowe lyeſt colde in the graue) now may I well bewayle the wante of thée, and mourning nowe may I bemone that I miſſe thée: if thou hadſt liued (ſuche was thy gouernement of the leaſt things) that thou wouldeſt prudently haue prouided for the preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation of this pearle. A coſtly iewell may I well accompte hir, that hath béen my chéefe comforte in youth, and is nowe become the coroſiue of mine age. O <hi>Polyneſta,</hi> full euill haſt thou requited the clemencie of thy carefull father: and yet to excuſe thée giltleſſe before God, and to condemne thée giltie before the worlde, I can count none other but my wretched ſelfe the caytife and cauſer of all my cares. For of al the due<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties that are requiſite in humane lyfe, onely obedience is by the parents to be required of the childe: where on y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> other

                           <p>I will tell you: when he was at home he did as moſt yong men doe, he played many mad prankes and did many things that liked me not very well: and I thinking, that by that time he had ſene the worlde, he would learne to know himſelfe better, exhorted him to ſtudie, and put in his electio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> what place he would go to. At the laſt he came hither, and I thinke he was ſcarce here ſo ſone as I felt the want of him, in ſuche ſorte, as from that day to this I haue paſſed fewe nightes without teares. I haue written to him very often that he ſhoulde come home, but continually he refuſed ſtil, beſeching me to continue his ſtudie, wherein he doubted not (as he ſaid) but to profite greatly.</p>

I feare he applies his ſtudie ſo, that he will not léeſe the minute of an houre from his booke. What, alas, he might yet talke with his country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men for a while: he is a yong man, tenderly brought vp, and if he fare thus co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinually night &amp; day at his booke, it may be enough to driue him into a freneſie.</p>

This is the beſt, and thus wil I do. Yet I know, that for mine owne parte I ſhal do bitter penance for my faults forepaſſed: but ſuche is the good will and duetie that I beare to <hi>Eroſtrato,</hi> as euen with the loſſe of my life I muſt not ſticke to aduenture any thing which may turne to his commoditie. But what ſhall I do? ſhal I go ſéeke my maſter about the towne, or ſhall I tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie his returne hither? If I méete him in the ſtréetes, he wil crie out vpon me, neither will he harken to any thing that I ſhall ſay, till he haue gathered all the people wondring a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout me, as it were at an Owle. Therefore I were better to abide here, and yet if he tarrie long I will goe ſéeke him, rather than prolong the time to <hi>Eroſtratos</hi> perill.</p>

                  <p>WHen he had well ſorted this ſequence, he ſought opor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunitie to leaue it where ſhée might finde it before it were loſt. And nowe the coles began to kindle, whereof (but ere while) ſhée feigned hir ſelfe altogither ignorant. The flames began to breake out on euery ſide: and ſhe to quench them, ſhut vp hir ſelfe in hir chamber ſolitarily. But as the ſmithie gathers greater heate by caſting on of water, euen ſo the more ſhe abſented hir ſelf from company, the freſher was the griefe whiche galded hir remembrance: ſo that at laſte the report was ſpredde thorough the houſe, that Miſtreſſe <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linor</hi> was ſicke. At which newes <hi>Ferdinando</hi> tooke ſmall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort: neuertheleſſe Dame <hi>Venus</hi> with good aſpect did yet thus
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:3023:218"/> much furder his enterpriſe. The Dame (whether it were by ſodaine chaunge, or of wonted cuſtome) fell one day into a greate bléeding at the noſe. For whiche accident the ſayde <hi>Venetian,</hi> amongſt other pretie conceits, had a preſent reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die: Whereby he tooke occaſion (when they of the houſe had all in vayne ſought many waies to ſtoppe hir bléeding) to worke his feate in this wiſe: Firſte he pleaded ignorance, as though he knewe not hir name, and therefore demaunded the ſame of Miſtreſſe <hi>Fraunces,</hi> who when ſhée had to him de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared that hir name was <hi>Elinor,</hi> hee ſayde theſe woordes or very like in effect: If I thought I ſhoulde not offend Miſtres <hi>Elynor,</hi> I woulde not doubte to ſtoppe hir bléeding, without eyther payne or difficultie. This Gentlewoman ſomewhat tickled with his woordes, did incontinent make relation thereof to the ſayde Miſtreſſe <hi>Elynor:</hi> who immediately (de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring that <hi>Ferdinando</hi> was hir late receyued ſeruaunt) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned the ſaide meſſanger vnto him with eſpeciall charge, that hee ſhoulde employ his deuoyre towardes the recouery of hir health: with whome the ſame <hi>Ferdinando</hi> repayred to the chamber of his deſired: and finding hir ſet in a chayre, leaning on the one ſide ouer a Siluer baſon: After his due reuerence, hée layde his hande on hir Temples, and priui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly rounding hir in hir eare, deſired hir to commaunde a Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zell ſticke and a knyfe: the whiche beyng brought, hée deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered vnto hir, ſaying on this wiſe. Miſtreſſe I will ſpeake certaine woordes in ſecrete to my ſelfe, and doe require no more: but when you heare me ſaie openly this woorde <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,</hi> that you with this knyfe will make a nicke vppon this Hazell ſticke: and when you haue made fiue nickes, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunde mée alſo to ceaſe. The Dame partly of good will to the Knight, and partly to be ſtenched of hir bléeding, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded hir mayde, and required the other Gentils, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what to ſtande aſide: whiche done, he began his Oraiſons, wherein he had not long muttered before he pronounced <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,</hi> wherwith the Lady made a nicke on the ſticke with hir knyfe. The ſaide <hi>Ferdinando</hi> continued to an other <hi>Amen,</hi>
                     <pb n="202" facs="tcp:3023:219"/> when y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lady hauing made an other nick, felt hir bléeding be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to ſteynch: &amp; ſo by the third <hi>Amen</hi> throughly ſteinched. <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinando</hi> then chaunging his prayers into priuat talk, ſaid ſoft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vnto hir: Myſtres, I am glad that I am hereby enabled to doe you ſome ſeruice, and as the ſtaunching of your owne bloud may ſome way recomfort you, ſo if the ſhedding of my bloud may any way content you, I beſéech you commaund it, for it ſhalbe euermore readily employed in your ſeruice: and therwithal with a loud voyce pronounced <hi>Amen:</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the good Lady making a nick, did ſecretly anſwere thus: Good ſeruant (quod ſhée) I muſt néedes think my ſelfe right happy to haue gained your ſeruice and good will, and be you ſure, that although ther be in me no ſuch deſert as may draw you into this depth of affection: yet ſuch as I am, I ſhalbe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes glad to ſhewe my ſelf thankfull vnto you. And now, if you thinke your ſelf aſſured that I ſhall bleede no more, doe then pronounce your fifth <hi>Amen:</hi> the which pronounced, ſhée made alſo hir fifth nicke, and held vp hir head, calling the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany vnto hir, and declaring vnto them, that hir bléeding was throughly ſteinched. And <hi>Ferdinando</hi> tarying a while in the chamber, found oportunitie to looſe his ſequence néere too his deſired Miſtres: And after <hi>congé</hi> taken, departed. After whoſe departure the Lady aroſe out of hir chayre, and hir mayd going about to remoue the ſame, eſpied, and toke vp the writing: the which hir miſtres perceiuing, gan ſodenly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iecture that the ſame had in it ſome like matter to the verſes once before left in like maner, and made ſemblant to miſtruſt that the ſame ſhould be ſome wordes of coniuration: and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king it from hir mayd, did peruſe it, and immediatly ſaid too the company, that ſhe would not forgo the ſame for a great treaſure. But to be plain, I think that (<hi>Ferdinando</hi> excepted) ſhe was glad to be rid of all company, vntill ſhe had with ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient leaſure turned ouer and retoſſed euery card in this ſequence. And not long after being now tickled thorough all the vaines with an vnknown humour, aduentured of hir ſelfe to commit vnto a like Ambaſſadour the diſcyphring

                  <p>THis letter was doubtles of hir own hande writing: and as therin the Reader may finde great difference of Style, from hir former letter, ſo may you now vnderſtand the cauſe. Shée had in the ſame houſe a friend, a ſeruant, a Secretary: what ſhould I name him? ſuch one as ſhée eſtéemed in time paſt more than was cauſe in tyme preſent. And to make my tale good, I will (by the ſame words that <hi>Bartello</hi> vſeth) diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribe him vnto you. He was in heigth the proportion of two <hi>Pigmeis,</hi> in bredth the thickneſſe of two bacon hogges, of preſumption a Gyant, of power a Gnatte, Apiſhly wyt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, Knauiſhly mannered, and crabbedly fauord. What was there in him then to drawe a fayre Ladies liking? Marry ſir euen all in all, a well lyned purſſe, wherewith he could at euery call, prouide ſuche pretie conceytes as pleaſed hir péeuiſh fantaſie: and by that meanes hée had throughly (long before) inſinuated him ſelfe with this amorous dame. This manling, this minion, this ſlaue, this ſecretary, was nowe by occaſion rydden too <hi>Florence</hi> forſothe: and though his abſenee were vnto hir a diſfurniſhing of eloquence: it was yet vntoo <hi>Ferdinando Ieromini</hi> an opportunitie of good aduauntage: for when hée perceiued the change of hir ſtile, and thereby grewe in ſome ſuſpition that the ſame pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>céeded
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:3023:220"/> by abſence of hir chiefe Chauncellor, he thought good now to ſmyte while the yron was hotte, and to lend his Miſtreſſe ſuche a penne in hir Secretaries abſence, as hée ſhould neuer be able (at his returne) to amend the well wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting therof. Wherfore according to hir co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maund he repayred once euery day to hir chamber, at the leaſt whereas hée guided himſelfe ſo wel, and could deuiſe ſuch ſtore of ſundry pleaſures and paſtymes, that he grew in fauour not onely with his deſired, but alſo with the reſt of the gentlewomen. And one day paſſing the time amongſt them, their playe grew to this end, that his Miſtreſſe, being Quéene, demaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of him theſe thrée queſtions. Seruant (quod ſhe) I charge you, aſwell vppon your allgiance being nowe my ſubiect, as alſo vpon your fidelitie, hauing vowed your ſeruice vnto me, that you aunſwere me theſe thrée queſtions, by the very truth of your ſecret thought. Firſt, what thing in this vniuerſall world doth moſt reioyce and comfort you? <hi>Ferdinando Ieroni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi</hi> abaſing his eyes towardes the ground, toke good aduiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in his aunſwere, when a fayre gentlewoman of the company clapped him on the ſhoulder, ſaying, how now ſir, is your hand on your halfpeny? To whome he aunſwered, no fayre Lady, my hand is on my harte, and yet my hart is not in myne owne hands: wherewithall abaſhed, turning towards dame <hi>Elinor</hi> he ſayde: My ſouereigne and Miſtreſſe, according to the charge of your command, and the dutie that I owe you, my tongue ſhall bewraye vnto you the truthe of mine intent. At this preſent a rewarde giuen me without deſert, doth ſo reioyce mée with continuall remembraunce, that though my minde be ſo occupied to thinke thereon, as that daye nor night I can bée quiet from that thought, yet the ioye and pleaſure whiche I conceiue in the ſame is ſuch, that I can neyther be cloyed with continuaunce thereof, nor yet afraide, that any miſhappe can counteruayle ſo greate a treaſure. This is to me ſuche a heauen to dwell in, as that I féede by day, and repoſe by night vppon the freſhe recorde of this reward. This (as <hi>Bartello</hi> ſayeth) he ment by the kiſſe
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:3023:220"/> that ſhe lent him in the Gallery, and by the profeſſion of hir laſte letters and woordes. Well, though this aunſwere bee ſomewhat miſtie, yet let his excuſe be: that taken vppon the ſodaine, he thought better to aunſwere darkly, than to be mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſted openly. Hir ſecond queſtion was, what thing in this life did moſte gréeue his harte, and diſquiet his minde, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto he anſwered. That although his late reherſed ioy were incomparable, yet the greateſt enimie that diſturbed the ſame, was the priuie worme of his owne giltie conſcience, which accuſed him euermore with great vnworthineſſe: and that this was his greateſt griefe. The Lady biting vpon the bitte at his cunning anſweres made vnto theſe two queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, ganne thus replie. Seruaunt, I had thought to haue touched you yet nearer with my thirde queſtion, but I will refrayne to attempt your pacience: and nowe for my third demaund, aunſwere me directly in what manner this paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion doth handle you? and howe theſe contraries may hang together by any poſſibilitie of concorde? for your woordes are ſtraunge. <hi>Ferdinando</hi> now rouſing himſelfe boldly, tooke oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion thus to handle his aunſwere. Miſtreſſe (quod he) my woordes in déede are ſtraunge, but yet my paſſion is muche ſtraunger: and thervpon this other day to conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t mine owne fantaſie I deuiſed a Sonet, which although it bée a péece of Cocklorels muſicke, and ſuche as I might be aſhamed to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh in this company, yet bicauſe my truth in this anſwere may the better appeare vnto you, I pray you vouchſafe to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue the ſame in writing: and drawing a paper out of his pocket, preſented it to hir, wherin was written this Sonet.</p>

                  <p>THis ſonet was highly commended, and in my iudgement it deſerueth no leſſe.

Think you ſo ſeruaunt (quod ſhe?) and the laſt tyme that I walked there, I ſuppoſe I toke the cauſe of my malady: but by your aduiſe (for that you haue ſo clerkly ſteynched my bléeding) I will aſſay to walke there to morow.

I would I thought ſo, quod the gentlewoman. And thus with prety nyppes, they paſſed ouer their ſupper: which ended, the Lord of the houſe required <hi>Ferdinando Ieronimi</hi> to daunce and paſſe the time with the gentlewomen, which he refuſed not to doe. But ſodenly, before the muſicke was well tuned, came out Dame <hi>Elynor</hi> in hir night attyre, and ſaid to the Lord, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> (ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing the ſolitarineſſe of hir chamber had encreaſed hir ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladie) ſhe came out for hir better recreatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to ſée them daunce. Well done daughter (quod the Lorde.) And I Miſtres (quod <hi>Ferdinando</hi>) would gladly beſtowe the leading of you about this great chamber, to driue away y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> faintneſſe of your feuer.

The daunce begon, this Knight marched on with the Image of S. <hi>Frances</hi> in his hand, and S. <hi>Elynor</hi> in his hart. The violands at end of the pauion ſtaied a whyle: in whiche time this Dame ſayde to <hi>Ferdinando Ieronimi</hi> on this wiſe: I am right ſory for you in two reſpects, although the familiarity haue hytherto had no great continuance betwene vs: and as I do lament your caſe, ſo doo I reioyce (for myne own conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation) that I ſhal now ſée a due triall of the experime<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t which I haue long deſired.

What experiment you meane to trie by mée, I knowe not, but I dare aſſure you, that my ſkill in experiments is very ſimple. Herewith the Inſtruments ſounded a new Meaſure, and they paſſed forthwards, leauing to talke, vntill the noiſe ceaſſed: whiche done, the Gentlewoman replied. I am ſory ſir, that you did erewhile, denie loue and all his lawes, and that in ſo open audience. Not ſo (quod <hi>Ferdinando</hi>) but as the woorde was roundly taken, ſo can I readely anſwere it by good reaſon. Well quod ſhée, howe if the hearers will admit no reaſonable anſwere? My reaſons yet bée neuertheleſſe (quod he) in reaſonable iudgement. Herewith ſhée ſmiled, and he caſt a glance towards dame <hi>Elinor,</hi>

Nay ſoft (quod ſhe) percaſe I haue not yet tolde you the firſt, but content your ſelfe, for the ſecond cauſe you ſhall neuer know at my handes, vntill I ſée due triall of the experiment which I haue long deſired.

His Miſtreſſe with chaunge of countenaunce kept ſilence whereat dame <hi>Fraunces</hi> reioycinge, caſt out this bone to gnawe on. I perceyue (quod ſhe) it is euill to halte before a Creple. <hi>Ferdinando</hi> perceyuing now that his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſe waxed angry, thought good on hir behalfe thus to aunſwere: and it is euill to hop before them that runne for the Bell: his Miſtreſſe replied, and it is euill to hange the Bell at their heeles which are alwayes running. The Lord of he Caſtle ouerhearing theſe proper quippes, roſe out of his chaire, &amp; comming towards <hi>Ferdinando</hi> requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him to daunce a Gallyard.

Whileſt hée was thus ſaying dame <hi>Elynor</hi> had made hir <hi>Congey,</hi> and was now entring the doore of hir chamber when <hi>Ferdinando</hi> al amazed at hir ſodeyne departure followed to take leaue of his Miſtreſſe: but ſhe more then angrie, refuſed to heare his good night, and entring hir chamber cauſed hir mayde to clappe to the doore. <hi>Ferdinando</hi> with heauie cheare re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to his company, and Miſtreſſe <hi>Fraunces</hi> to toutch his ſore with a coroſiue, ſayd to him ſoftly in this wiſe. Sir you may now perceyue that this our countrie cannot allowe the French manner of dauncing, for they (as I haue heard tell) do more commonly daunce to talke, then
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:3023:223"/> entreate to daunce. <hi>Fardenando</hi> hoping to driue out one naile with another and thinking this a meane moſte con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient to ſuppreſſe all ielous ſuppoſes, tooke Miſtreſſe <hi>Fraunces</hi> by the hand and with a heauy ſmile aunſwered.

At laſt the Ladies going towardes the horſebacke called for him in the baſe Court, and demaunded if he were readie: to whome hée aunſwered. Madame, I am more than readie, and yet not ſo ready as I would be, and immediatly taking him ſelfe in trip, he thought beſt to vtter no more of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipt, but in haſt more than good ſpede mounted his horſe, &amp; comming toward y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> dames preſented himſelfe, turning, bounding, &amp; taking vp his courſer to the vttermoſt of his power in brauery: after ſuffering his horſe to breath him ſelfe, he gan alſo allay his owne choller, &amp; to the dames he ſayd.

Dame <hi>Elinor</hi> litle remembring the occaſion, replied it is no matter ſeruaunt, quod ſhe, you ſhall heare of it againe, I warrant you, and preſently wee ryde in Gods peace, and I truſt ſhall haue no néede of it: yet Miſtres quod he, a weapo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſerueth both vſes, aſwell to defe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, as to offend. Now my by troth, quod Dame <hi>Fraun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi> I haue now my dreame, for I dreamt this night that I was in a pleaſaunt medow alone, where I met with a tall Gentleman, apparrelled in a night gowne of ſilke, all embroadered about with a garde of naked ſwordes, and when he came towards me I ſéemed to be afrayd of him, but he recomforted me ſaying, be not afrayd fayre Lady, for I vſe this garment onely for mine owne defence: and in this ſort went that warrelike God <hi>Mars,</hi> what time hée taught Dame <hi>Venus</hi> to make <hi>Vulcan</hi> a hammer of the new faſhion. Notwithſtanding theſe comfortable words, the fright of the dreame awaked me, and ſithens vnto this hower I haue not ſlept at al. And what time of the night dreamt you this quod <hi>Fardinando?</hi> In the grey morning about dawning of the day, but why aſke you quod Dame <hi>Frances?

The Dames continued in theſe and like pleaſaunt talkes: but <hi>Ieronomij</hi> coulde not be mery, as on that eſtemed the preſeruation of his miſtres honor, no leſe then the obteyning of his owne delightes, and yet to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoyd

The Lady <hi>Elynor</hi> (more careleſſe then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideratiue of hir owne caſe) pricking forwardes ſayd ſoft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to him, I had thought you had receiued ſmall cauſe ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaunt to be thus dumpiſh, when I would be mery. Alas déere miſtreſſe quod he, it is altogether for your ſake, that I am penſife: Dame <hi>Fraunces</hi> of courteſie with drewe hir ſelfe and gaue them leaue, when as <hi>Ferdina<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>do</hi> decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vnto his Miſtres, that his ſworde was taken out of his chamber, and that he dreaded much by the wordes of the Lady <hi>Fraunces,</hi> that ſhe had ſome vnderſtanding of the mater. Dame <hi>Elynor</hi> now calling to remembrance what had paſſed the ſame night, at the firſt was abaſhed, but immediatly (for theſe women be redily witted) chered hir ſeruaunt, and willed him to commit vnto hir the ſaluing of that ſore. Thus they paſſed the reſt of the way in plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaunt talke with dame <hi>Fraunces,</hi> and ſo returned towards the Caſtle where <hi>Ieronimy</hi> ſuffered the two dames to go together, and he alone vnto his chamber to bewayle hys own miſgouernment. But dame <hi>Elynor</hi> (whether it were according to olde cuſtome, or by wilye pollycye) founde meane that nyght, that the ſworde was conueyed out of Miſtres <hi>Fraunces</hi> chamber, and brought vnto hirs: and after redeliuerye of it vnto hir ſeruaunt, ſhe warned hym to be more wary from that time forthwardes: afterward when he grew more bold and better aquaynted with his Miſtris diſpoſition, hee aduentured one Frydaye in the morning to go vnto hir Chamber, and therevpon wrote as followeth: which he termed a Frydayes Breakefaſt.</p>

<pb n="230" facs="tcp:3023:233"/> Well <hi>Ferdinando</hi> had his deſire, yf his Miſtreſſe lyked them, but as <hi>Bartello</hi> writeth, ſhee grewe in ielouſie, that the ſame were not written by hir, becauſe hir name was <hi>Elynor</hi> and not <hi>Hellen.</hi> And about this point haue béen di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers and ſundry opinions among the <hi>Venetians,</hi> for this &amp; diuers other of his moſt notable Poems, haue come to view of the world.

And in déede conſidering all circumſtaunces of hiſtories, and comparing alſo the time that ſuche reportes do ſpreade of his acquaintaunce with <hi>Hellen,</hi> it cannot be written leſſe then ſixe or ſeuen yéeres before he knewe <hi>Hellen:</hi> marrye peraduenture if there were any acquaintaunce betwéene him and that <hi>Hellen</hi> afterwardes, he might adapt it to hir name, and ſo make it ſerue boath their turnes, as el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der louers haue done before, and ſtill doe, and wyll doe world without ende.

                  <p>OF this Sonet, were it not a lyttle to muche prayſe (as the Italians do moſt commonly offend in the ſuperla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue) I could no more commend it: but I hope the party to whome it was dedicated: had rather it were much more, than any thing leſſe. Wel, thus theſe twoo Louers paſſed many daies in excéeding contentation, &amp; more than ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able pleaſures, in which time <hi>Ferdinando</hi> did compile ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry many verſes according to ſundrye occaſions proffred, and they were for the moſt parte fauced with a taſte of glory, as you know that in ſuch caſes a louer being char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged with inexprimable ioyes, and therewith enioyned both by duety and diſcrecion to kéepe the ſame couert, can by no meanes deuiſe a greater conſolation, than to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit it into ſome cyphred wordes, and figured ſpeaches, in verſe, whereby he feeleth his heart halfe (or more than halfe) eaſed of ſwelling. For as ſighes are ſome preſent eaſe to the penſiue minde, euen ſo we find by experience, that ſuch ſecréete enteredmoning of ioyes doeth encreaſe delight. I would not haue you conſter my wordes to this
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:3023:234"/> effect, that I thinke a man cannot ſufficientlye reioyce in the luckie lottes of loue, vnleſſe he empart the ſame to others: God forbid that euer I ſhould enter into ſuch an heriſie, for I haue alwayes bene of this opinion, that as to be fortunate in loue, is one of the moſt inward conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations to mans mind of all earthly ioyes: euen ſo if hée do but once bewray y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame to any liuing creature, imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly either dread of diſcouering doth bruſe his breſt with an intollerable burden, or els he leeſeth the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall vertue which gaue effect to his gladnes, not vnlyke to a Poticares pot, which being filled with ſwéete oynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes or perfumes, doth retayne in it ſelfe ſome ſent of the ſame, and being powred out doeth returne to the former ſtate, hard, harſh, and of ſmall ſauour: So the mind being fraught with delightes, as long as it can kepe them ſecretly encloſed, may continually féede vpon the pleaſaunt record thereof, as the wel wylling and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die horſe byteth on the bridle, but hauing once diſcloſed them to any other, ſtraight waye we looſe the hidden trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of the ſame, and are oppreſſed with ſundry doubtfull opinions and dreadfull conceiptes. And yet for a man to record vnto him ſelfe in the inward contemplation of his mind, the often remembrance of his late receiued ioyes, doth as it were eaſe the hearte of burden, and ad vnto the mind a freſh ſupplie of delight, yea, and in vearſe princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally (as I conceyue) a man may beſt contriue his waye of comfort in him ſelfe. Therfore as I haue ſayde <hi>Ferdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nando</hi> ſwimming nowe in delightes did nothing but writ ſuch verſe as might acumilat his ioyes, to the extremitie of pleaſure, the which for that purpoſe he kept from ſight of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> world, as one more deſirous to ſeme obſcure &amp; defec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue, than ouermuch to glory in his aduentures, eſpecially for y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> in the end his hap was as heauie, as hitherto he had ben fortunate. And here I wyll ſurceaſe to rehearſe any more of his verſes vntil I haue expreſſed how y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> his ioyes
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:3023:234"/> being exalted to the higheſt degrée began to bend towards declinatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. For now the vnhappy <hi>Secretary</hi> whom I haue before reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bred, was returned from <hi>Florence,</hi> on whom <hi>Fardinando</hi> had no ſoner caſt his eies, but immediatly he fell into a great paſſion of minde, which might be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pared vnto a feauer. This fruit grew of the good inſtructions y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> his <hi>Hope</hi> had planted in his mind, whereby I might take iuſt occaſion to forwarn euery louer, how they ſuffer this venemous ſerpent ielouſie to créepe into their conceipts: for ſurely, of al other diſeaſes in loue, I ſuppoſe that to be vncurable, and would hold longer diſcourſe therin, were it not y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> both this tale &amp; the verſes of <hi>Ferdinando</hi> him ſelfe hereafter to be recited, ſhalbe ſufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to ſpeake for me in this behalf. The louer (as I ſay vpon the ſodain) was dro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen into ſuch a malladie, as no meate might nouriſhe his body, no delightes pleaſe his minde, no remembrance of ioyes forepaſſed content him, nor any hope of the lyke to come might recomfort him: hereat (ſome vnto whome I haue imparted this tale) haue take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> occaſion to diſco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mend his fainting heart, yet ſurely the cauſe inwardly &amp; déeply conſidered, I cannot ſo lightly condempne him: for an old ſaying is, that euerye man can giue councell better than followe it: and néedes muſt the conflicts of his thoughts be ſtraunge: betwéene the remembraunce of his forepaſſed pleaſure, and the preſent ſight of this monſter, whom be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore (for lacke of like inſtruction) he had not ſo throughlye marked and beheld. Well, ſuch was the griefe vnto him, that he became ſickly and kept his chamber. The Ladies hauing receiued the newes thereof, gan al at once lament his miſfortune, &amp; of common conſent agréed to viſit him: they marched thither in good equipage, I warant you, and fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d <hi>Ferdinando</hi> lying vpon his bed languiſhing, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they all ſaluted generally, and ſought to recomfort: but eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>allye his Miſtreſſe, hauing in hir hand a braunce of wyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, wherewith ſhée defended hir from the whot aire, gan
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:3023:235"/> thus ſay vnto him: Seruaunt (quod ſhe) for that I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe your mallady to procéede of none other cauſe but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſlouthfulneſſe, I haue brought this preaty rod to beate you a little: nothing doubting, but when you feele the ſmart of a twig or twayne, you will like a tractable yong ſcholler, pluck vp your quickned ſpirits, &amp; caſt this drowſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe apart. <hi>Ferdinando</hi> with a great ſigh anſwered: Alas good Miſtres (quod he) if any like chaſtiſement might quic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> me, how much more might the preſence of all you loue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Dames recomfort my dulled mind? whome to behold, were ſufficient to reuiue an eye now dazled with the dread of death: &amp; that not onely for the heauenly aſpects whiche you repreſent, but alſo much the more for your excéeding curteſie, in that you haue deigned to viſit mée ſo vnwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie a ſeruaunt. But good Miſtreſſe (quod he) as it were ſhame for me to confeſſe that euer my hart coulde yéelde for feare, ſo I aſſure you that my minde cannot be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to induce infirmitie by ſluggiſhe conceyt: But in trueth Miſtreſſe I am ſicke (quod he,) and therewithall the trembling of his hart had ſent vp ſuche throbbing into his throte, as that his voyce (now depriued of breath) com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded the tong to be ſtill. When Dame <hi>Elynor</hi> for compaſſion diſtilled into teares, and drew towardes the window, leauing the other Gentlewomen about his bed, who being no leſſe ſorye for his griefe, yet for that they were none of them ſo touched in their ſecrete thoughtes, they had bolder ſprits and fréeer ſpeach to recomfort him, amongeſt the reſt the Lady <hi>Fraunces,</hi> (who in deede loued him déepely, and could beſt coniecture the cauſe of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipts) ſayd vnto him: Good <hi>Trust</hi> (quod ſhée) if any helpe of Phiſick may cure your maladie, I would not haue you hurt your ſelfe with theſe doubts whiche you ſéeme to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne: If choice of Diet may helpe, beholde vs here (your cookes) ready to miniſter all things néedefull: if company may driue away your anoye, wee meane not to leaue
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:3023:235"/> you ſolitary, if griefe of mind be cauſe of your infirmitie, wée all here will offer our deuoyre to turne it into ioye: if miſhap haue giuen you cauſe to feare or dreade any thing, remember <hi>Hope,</hi> which neuer fayleth to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort an afflicted minde. And good <hi>Trust</hi> (quod ſhe) (diſtrei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning his hand right hartely) let this ſimple proofe of our poore good willes bee ſo excepted of you, as that it maye work therby the effect of our deſires. <hi>Ferdinando</hi> (as on in a traunce) had marked very litle of hir curteouſe talke, &amp; yet gaue hir thankes, and ſo held his peace whereat the Ladyes (being all amazed) there became a ſilence in the chamber on all ſides. Dame <hi>Elynor</hi> fearing thereby that ſhe might the more eaſely be eſpyed, and hauing nowe dryed vp hir teares, retourned to hir ſeruaunt, recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forting him by all poſſible meanes of common curteſie, promiſing that ſince in hir ſicknes he had not only ſtaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched hir bleding, but alſo by his gentle company and ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry deuices of honeſt paſtime, had driuen a waye the pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiuenes of hir mind, ſhe thought hir ſelfe bound with like willingnes to do hir beſt in any thing that might reſtore his health, &amp; taking him by the hand ſaid further. Good ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaunte, if thou beare in deed any true affection to thy poore Miſtres, ſtart vpon thy féet again, and let hir enioye thine accuſtomed ſeruice to hir co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fort, for ſure (quod ſhe) I will neuer leaue to viſite this chamber once in a daye, vntill I may haue thée downe with mée, <hi>Ferdinando</hi> hearyng the harty woordes of his Miſtris, and perceiuyng the earneſt maner of hir pronunciation, began to receyue vnſpeake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able comfort in the ſame, and ſayd: Miſtris, your excée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyng courteſie were able to reuiue a man half dead, and to me it is bothe great comfort, and it doeth alſo glad my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>brance, with a continual ſmart of myne owne vnwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſſe: but as I woulde deſire no longer life, than til I might be able to deſerue ſome part of your bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ty, ſo I wil endeuor my ſelf to liue, were it but only vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ende, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> I

Thus ſayd, the Ladies taried not long before they were called to Euenſong, when his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtres taking his hand, kiſſed it ſaying: Farewel good ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaunt, and I praye thée ſuffer not the mallice of thy ſicke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to ouercome the gentleneſſe of thy good hart. <hi>Fardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nando</hi> rauiſhed with ioy, ſuffered them all to departe, and was not able to pronounce one word. After their depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, he gan caſt in his mind the exceeding curteſie vſed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes him by them all, but aboue all other the bounty of his Myſtreſſe: and therwithall tooke a ſound &amp; firme opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, that it was not poſſible for hir to cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>terfeite ſo deepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly (as in déede I beleeue that ſhee then did not) wherby he ſodenly felt his hert greatly eaſed, and began in himſelfe thus to reaſon. Was euer man of ſo wretched a heart? I am the moſt bounden to loue (quod he) of all them that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer poſſeſſed his ſeruice, I enioy one the fayreſt that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer was found, and I finde hir the kindeſt that euer was hearde of: yet in mine owne wicked heart, I coulde vila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouſly conceyue that of hir, which being compared with the reſt of hir vertues, is not poſſible to harbour in ſo no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble a mind. Herby I haue brought my ſelf without cauſe into this féebleneſſe: and good reaſon that for ſo high an offence, I ſhould be puniſhed with great infirmitie: what ſhall I then doe? yelde to the ſame? no, but according to my late proteſtation, I will recomfort this languiſhing minde of mine, to the ende I may liue but onely to do pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunce for this ſo notable a cryme ſo raſhly committed: and thus ſaying, he ſtart from his bed, and gan to walke towardes the window: but the venimous ſerpent which (as before I rehearſed) had ſtong him, coulde not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent that theſe medicines applyed by the mouth of his gentle Miſtreſſe, ſhould ſo ſoone reſtorte him to gueriſon.
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:3023:236"/> And although in dede they were ſuch <hi>Nythrydate</hi> to him as that they had nowe expelled the rancour of the poyſon yet that ougly helliſhe monſter had left behind hir in the moſt ſecret of his boſome, (euen betwene the minde and the man) one of hir familiers named <hi>ſuspect,</hi> whiche gan work in the weake ſpirites of <hi>Ferdinando</hi> efectes of no leſe perill than before he had receiued, his head ſwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling with theſe troublſome toyes, and his hart ſwimming in the tempeſts of toſſing fantaſie: he felt his legges ſo fée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that he was co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtrayned to lie down on his bed again, and repeating in his own remembraunce euery woorde that his miſtres had ſpoken vnto him, he gan to dread, that ſhe had brought the willow braunche to beate hym with, in token that he was of hir forſaken: for ſo louers do moſt commonly expound the willow garlande, and this to thinke, did cut his hart in twayne. A wonderfull chaunge: and here a little to ſtaye you, I will diſcribe as I finde it in <hi>Bartello the beginning,</hi> the fall, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tourne, and the being of this helliſh byrde, who in déede maye well bée counted a very lymbe of the Diuill.

<pb n="238" facs="tcp:3023:237"/> but only his wife: and at the foote therof kept alwaies by daye light, a fierce maſtife cloſe enkeneled which neuer ſawe nor hearde the face or voice of any other creature but onelye of them twoo: him by night he truſted with the ſcout of this prety paſſage, hauing neuertheleſſe betwéen him &amp; this dogge, a double doore with treble lockes, qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drible barres, and before all a port coulez of Iron: neither yet could he bée ſo hardye as to ſléepe, vntyll he had cauſed a garde of ſeruauntes (whome he kept abroade for that purpoſe) to ſearch all the corners adioyning to all his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſe, and that betwéene fearefull ſweate and chyuering cold, with one eye opened &amp; the other cloſed, he ſtole ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times a broken ſléepe, deuided with many terrible drea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes.

Miſtreſſe quod he, I haue aſſayed my féete ſince your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture, but I finde them yet vnable too ſuport my heauy body, and therefore am conſtrayned as you ſée, to acquaint my ſelfe with theſe pillowes. Seruaunt ſayde ſhe I am right ſory therof, but ſince it is of neceſſitie to beare ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, I will employ my endeuoyre to allay ſome parte of your paynes, and to refreſhe your weary limbes with ſome comfortable matter: and therewithall calling hir hande mayde, deliuered vnto hir a bounch of pretie littell keyes, and whiſpering in hir eare, diſpatched hir towards hir chamber: The mayde taryed not long, but returned with a little Caſket, the which hir miſtreſſe toke, opened and drewe out of the ſame much fine linnen, amongſt the which ſhe toke a pillowebere very fine and ſweete, which although it were of it ſelfe as ſwéete as might be (being of long time kept in that odoriferous cheſt) yet did ſhe with damaſke water and that of the beſt that might be (I warrant you) al to ſprinkle it with hir owne handes, which in my conceipt might much amende the matter. Then calling for a freſh pillowe, ſent hir mayde to ayre the ſame and at hir returne put on this, thus perfumed
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:3023:240"/> pillowebéere. In meane time alſo ſhée had with hir owne hands attyred hir ſeruaunts head in a fayre wrought ker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chife taken out of the ſame Caſket: then layde him downe vppon this freſhe and pleaſaunt place, and pretelye as it were in ſporte, bedewed his temples with ſwéete water which ſhe had readye in a caſting bottle of Golde, kiſſing his chéeke and ſaying: Good ſeruaunt be whoale, for I might not long indure thus to attend thée, and yet the loue that I beare towardes thée, cannot be content to ſée thée languiſhe. Miſtreſſe ſayde <hi>Ferdinando</hi> (and that with a trembling voice) aſſure your ſelfe, that if there remain in me any ſparke of life or poſſibillity of recouery, then may this excellent bounty of yours be ſufficient to reuiue me without any further trauaile or paine vnto your perſon: for whome I am highlye to blame, in that I do not ſpare to put you vnto this trouble, &amp; better it were that ſuche a wretch as I had died vnknown, than y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> by your excéeding curteſie, you ſhould fall into any malladye, eyther by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorting vnto me, or by theſe your paines taken about me. Seruaunt (quod ſhee) all pleaſures ſéeme painefull to to them that take no delight therin, and lykewiſe all toile ſéemeth pleaſaunt to ſuch as ſet their felicitie in the ſame: but for me bee you ſure, I doe it with ſo good a wyll that I can take no hurt thereby, vnleſſe I ſhall perceyue that it be reiected or neglected, as vnprofitable or vncomfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table vnto you. To me Miſtreſſe quod <hi>Fardinando,</hi> it is ſuche pleaſure, as neyther my féeble tongue can expreſſe, nor my troubled mind conceyue. Why? are you troubled in mind, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſeruant quod dame <hi>Elynor? Ferdinando</hi> now bluſhing anſwered, but euen as al ſick men be Miſtreſſe. Herewith they ſtaied their talke a while, and the firſt that brake ſilence was the Ladye <hi>Fraunces:</hi> who ſayde, and to driue away y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> troubles of your mind good <hi>Truſt,</hi> I would be glad if we coulde deuiſe ſome paſtime amongſt vs to kéepe you company: for I remember that with ſuch deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes

Euery body thinketh their own greif greateſt <abbr>qd</abbr> dame <hi>Elynor,</hi> but in deede whether my greife were the more or the leſſe, I am right ſorye that yours is ſuch as it is: And to aſſay whither our paſſions proceded of lyke cauſe or not, I would we could (according to this Ladyes ſaying) deuiſe ſome like paſtimes to trie if your malladie would be cured with like medicines. A gentle woman of the company whom I haue not hetherto named, gan thus propound. We haue accuſtomed (quod ſhe) heretofore in moſt of our games to chuſe a King or Quene, and he or ſhe during their gouernment, haue charged euery of vs, ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with commaundementes or queſtions, as beſt ſée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to their maieſtie.

And though in déed in queſtioning (which doth of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> twaine more nerely touch the mind) euery on is at frée liberty to anſwere what they liſt: yet oft haue I hearde a queſtion demaunded in ſuch ſorte, and vpon ſuch ſodayne, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it hath bene hardly anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red without mouing matter of contencion. And in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundes alſo, ſome times it happeneth one to bée com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded vnto ſuch ſeruice, as eyther they are vnfit to accompliſh (and then the parties weaknes is therby de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected) or els to doe ſomething that they would not, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of enſueth more grutch than game. Wherefore in mine opinion, we ſhall do well to chuſe by lot amongſt vs a go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernour, who (for that it ſhalbe ſufficient preheminence to vſe the chayre of maieſtie,) ſhalbe bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d to giue ſente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce vppon al ſuche arguments and queſtions as we ſhall or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly propound vnto them: and from him or her (as from

This dame had ſtuffe in her, an old cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier, &amp; a wylie wenche, named <hi>Pergo.</hi> Wel this proportio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of <hi>Pergo</hi> pleaſed them well, and by lot it hapned that <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinando</hi> muſt be moderator of theſe matters, and colector of theſe cauſes. The which being ſo conſtituted, the Lady <hi>Elynor</hi> ſayd vnto this dame <hi>Pergo.</hi> You haue deuiſed this paſtime (quod ſhe) &amp; becauſe we thinke you to be moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pert in the handling therof, do you propound the firſt que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, &amp; we ſhalbe both the more ready and able to follow your example y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lady <hi>Pergo</hi> refuſed not, but began on this wiſe. Noble gouernor (quod ſhe) amongſt the aduentures that haue befallen mée, I remember eſpecially this one, that in youth it was my chaunce to bée beloued of a verye courtlike yong Gentleman, who abode neare the place wherin my parents had their reſiaunce. This gentleman (whether it were for beauty, or for any other reſpect that he ſawe in me, I knowe not) but he was enamored of me, &amp; that with an excéeding vehement paſſion, &amp; of ſuch force were his effectes, that notwithſtanding many repulſes which he had receiued at my handes, he ſeemed daylye to grow in the renewing of his deſires. I on the other ſide, although I could by no meanes miſlike of him by any good reaſon (conſidering that he was of byrth no waye inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our vnto mée, of poſſeſſions not to bée diſdamed, of parſon right comelye, of behauiour Courtly, of manners modeſt, of mynde lyberall, and of vertuous diſpoſition) yet ſuche was the gaitye of my minde, as that I coulde not bée con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to lende him ouer large thonges of my loue: but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes daungerouſlye behaued my ſelfe towardes him, and in ſuche ſorte, as hee coulde neyther take comfort of myne aunſweres, nor yet once finde him ſelfe requited with one good looke for all his trauaile. This notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, the worthy Knight continewed his ſute with no leſſe vehement affection than earſt hée had begonne
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:3023:241"/> it, euen by the ſpace of ſeuen yeares, At the laſt, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther diſcomfited by my dealynges, or tryed by long tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uayle, or that he hade parcaſe light vpon the lake that is in the forreſt of <hi>Ardena,</hi> and ſo in haſte and all thriſtie, had dronke ſome droppes of diſdayne, whereby his hot flames were quenched, or that he had vndertaken to ſerue no longer, but his iuſt tearme of apprenticehode, or that the téeth of tyme had gnawen and tyred his dulled ſpirites in ſuch ſort, as that all bée nummed hee was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrayned to vſe ſome other artificyal balme for the quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of his ſences, or by what cauſe moued I knowe not he did not onely leaue his long continued ſute, but (as I haue ſince perceiued) grew to hate me more deadly than before I had diſdained him. At the firſt beginnyng of his retyre I perceiued not his hatred, but imagened that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ouer wearied, he had withdrawen himſelf for a time. And conſidering his worthines, ther withall his conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie of long time proued, I thoughe that I could not in the whole world find out a fitter match to beſtowe my ſelfe, than one ſo worthy a perſon. Wherfore I doe by al poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble meanes procure that he might eftſones vſe his accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomed repraye vnto my parentes: And further, in al pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces where I hapened to meete him, I vſed al the curte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies towardes him that might be contayned wythin the bondes of modeſtie. But al was in vaine, for he was now become more daungerous to be wone, than the haggard Faulcon. Our lottes being thus vnluckely chaunged, I grewe to burne in deſire, and the more daungerous that he ſhewed him ſelfe vnto me, the more earneſt I was by all meanes to procure his conſent of loue. At the laſt I might perceiue that not only he diſdayned me, but (as me thought (boyled in hatred againſt me. And the time that I thus continued tormented with theſe thoughts, was alſo iuſt the ſpace of ſeuen yeares. Finally when I perceiued no remedye for my perplexityes, I aſſayed by abſence to
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:3023:242"/> were away this malady, and therefore vtterly refuſed to come in his preſence, yea or almoſt in any other com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany. Wherby I haue conſumed in loſt time the flower of my youth, &amp; am become as you ſée (what with yeares, and what with the tormenting paſſions of loue) pale, wane, and full of wrinkles. Neuertheleſſe, I haue therby gayned thus much, that at laſt I haue wond my ſelf cléere out of <hi>Cupids</hi> chaynes, and remayne careleſſe at libertie. Now marke to what end I tell you this: firſt vii. yeares paſſed in the which I could neuer be content to yeld vnto his iuſt deſires: next other vii. yeares I ſpent in ſéeking to recouer his loſt loue: and ſithens both thoſe vii. yeares, there are euen now on ſaint <hi>Valentines</hi> day laſt, other vii. yeares paſſed, in the which (neither I haue deſired to ſée him) nor he hath coueted to here of me. My parents now perceyuing how the crowes foot is crept vnder mine eye, and remembring the long ſute that this gentelema<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> had in youth ſpent on me, conſidering therewith all that grene youth is well mellowed in vs both, haue of late ſought to perſwade a marriage betwene vs, the which the Knighte hath not refuſed to here of, and I haue not diſdayned to thinke on. By their mediation we haue bene eftſoones brought to <hi>Parlee,</hi> wherein ouer and be ſides the ripping vp of many olde griefes, this hath bene cheifly rehearſed &amp; obiected betwene vs, what wrong and iniury eche of vs hath done to other. And here aboutes wée haue fallen to ſharpe contencion. He alleadged, that much greater is the wrong which I haue done vnto him, than that repulſe which hée hath fithenes vſed to me: and I haue affirmed the contrary. The matter yet hangeth in varyence. Now, of you worthy Gouernour I would be moſt glad to heare this queſtion decided, remembring that there was no dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference in the times betwene vs. And ſurely, vnles your iudgment helpe me, I am afrayde my marryage will hée marred, and I may go lead Apes in hell. <hi>Ferdenando</hi> aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered,
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:3023:242"/> good <hi>Pergo,</hi> I am ſory to heare ſo lamentable a diſcourſe of your luckles loue, and much the ſoryer, in y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> I muſte néedes giue ſentence agaynſt you. For ſurely great was the wrong that eyther of you haue done to other, and greater was the néedeleſſe greife which cauſeleſſe eche of you hath conceyued in this long time, but greateſt in my iudgment hath bene both the wrong and the greife of the Knight. In that notwithſtanding his deſertes (which your ſelfe confeſſe) he neuer enioyed any guerdone of loue at your handes. And you (as you alledge) did enioy his loue of long time to gether. So that by the reckoning, it wil fal out (although being builded in your owne conceipt, you ſée it not) that of the one &amp; twenty yeares you enioyed his loue vii. at the leaſt, but that euer he enioyed yours wee cannot perceiue. And much greater is the wrong that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardeth euill for good, than that which requireth tip for tap. Further, it ſemeth that where as you went obout in time to trie him, you did altogither looſe time which can neuer be recouered. And not only loſt your owne time, whereof you would ſeeme nowe to lament, but alſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled him to leaſe his time, which he might (be it ſpoken with out offence to you) haue beſtowed in ſome other worthy place, and therefore, as that greife is much grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which hath no kind of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fort to allay it, ſo much more is that wrong which altogether without cauſe is offered. And I (ſayd <hi>Pergo</hi>) muſt needes think, that much eaſier is it for them to endure grief which neuer taſted of ioye, and much leſſe is that wrong which is ſo willingly proffered to be by recompence reſtored. For if this Knight wil con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe that he neuer had cauſe to reioyce in all the time of his ſeruice, then with better contentacion might he abyde greife than I, who hauing taſted of the delight which I did ſecretly co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceiue of his deſertes, do think ech grief a preſent death by the remembrance of thoſe for paſſed thoughts: &amp; leſſe wrong ſéemeth it to be deſtitut of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> thing which was
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:3023:243" rendition="simple:additions"/> neuer obtained, then to be depriued of a Iewel wherof we haue been already poſſeſſed, ſo that vnder your correction I might conclude, that greater hath béene my griefe and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iury ſuſteined, than that of the Knight. To whome <hi>Ieroni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my</hi> replied, as touching delight, it maye not be denied but that euery louer doth take delight in the inward contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation of his mind, to think of the worthines of his belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued: &amp; therefore you maie not alledge that the Knight had neuer cauſe to reioyce, vnleſſe you will altogeather con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne your ſelfe of worthines. Mary if you will ſay that he taſted not the delightes that louers ſeeke, then marke, who was the cauſe but your ſelfe? And if you would accuſe him of like ingratitude, for y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he diſdained you in the later vij. yéeres (when as he might by accepting your loue, haue reco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>penced him ſelfe of all former wronges) you muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member therewithall, that the crueltie by you ſhewed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him was ſuch, that he could by no means perceiue that your change procéeded of good will, but rather eftſons to hold him enchained in vnknown linkes of ſubtile dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, &amp; therefore not without cauſe he doubted you: &amp; yet without cauſe you reiected him. He had often ſought occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, but by your refuſals he could neuer find him, you ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing occaſion faſt by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> foretop, did dally with him ſo long, tyl at the laſt he ſliped his head from you, &amp; then catching at the bald noddle, you fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d your ſelfe the cauſe, &amp; yet you would accuſe another. To conclude, greater is the griefe that is ſuſteined without deſert, &amp; much more is the wro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g that is offered without cauſe. Thus <hi>Ferdinando Ieronimy</hi> decided the queſtion propounded by <hi>Pergo,</hi> and expected that ſome other Dame ſhould propound another? but his Miſtreſſe (hauing hir hand on another halfpeny) gan thus ſay vnto him. Seruant this paſtime is good, and ſuch as I muſt nedes like of, to driue away your penſiue thoughtes: but ſléeping time approcheth, &amp; I feare we diſquiete you: wherefore the reſt of this time we will (if ſo like you) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowe

Thus he laye ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſhed, commaunding his ſeruaunt to goe to bed, and fay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning that him ſelfe would aſſaye if he could ſléepe.

Here withall I cannot forget the ſundry aduentures hapned ſince wee became one hart deuided in two bodyes, all which haue ben both happily atchiued, and delectable enioyed.

The firſt coro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiue that I haue felt, and the laſt cordiall that I looke for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the end of my ioyes, and the beginning of my torments.

And peraduenture ſhe refrayned (either of curteſie towards him, or for womaniſh feare, to hurt her tender hande) to ſtrike him on the chéekes in ſuch ſort, as they doe that ſtriue to call againe a dying creature: and therefore thought this the apteſt meane to reduce him vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to remembrance. <hi>Ferdinando</hi> now awaked, could no leſſe doe, than of his curteous nature receiue his Miſtreſſe into his bed: Who (as one that knewe that waye better, than

                  <p>Nowe, here I would demaunde of ſuch as are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perte: Is there any greater impedymente to the fruition of a Louers delights, than to be miſtruſted? or rather, is it not the ready way to race all loue and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer good will out of remembrance, to tell a guilty mind
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:3023:246"/> that you do miſtruſt it? It ſhould ſeeme yes, by Dame <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lynor,</hi> who began now to take the matter whotlye: and of ſuch vehemencie were hir fancies, that ſhe nowe fell into flat defiance with <hi>Ferdinando,</hi> who although he ſought by many faire wordes to temper hir chollorike paſſions, and by yelding him ſelfe to get the conqueſt of an other, yet could he by no meanes determine the quarrell. The ſoft pillowes being preſent at al theſe whot ſpeches, put forth them ſelues as mediators for a truce betwene theſe ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and deſired that (if they would néedes fight) it might be in their preſence but one only blowe, &amp; ſo from thence forth to become friendes againe for euer. But the Dame denied flatlye, alledging that ſhée found no cauſe at all to vſe ſuch curteſie vnto ſuch a recreant: adding further ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny words of great reproche: the which dyd ſo enrage <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinando,</hi> as that hauing forgotten all former curteſies, he aſſayleth his enemies by force. At laſt ſhe roſe ſodain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye and determined to ſaue hir ſelfe by flight, leauing him in bedde, with many deſpitefull wordes, and ſwearing that he ſhoulde neuer (eftſones) take her at the lyke ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uauntage: the whiche oathe ſhe kepte better than hir fourmer profeſſed good wyll: and hauing nowe reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered her Chamber (becauſe ſhee founde her hurt to be nothing daungerous) I doubte not, but ſhée ſlept qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etlye the reſt of the night. As <hi>Ferdinando</hi> alſo (perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding himſelfe that he ſhoulde with conuenient leaſure re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couer her from this haggard conceipt) tooke ſome better reſt towardes the morning, than hee had done in many nightes forepaſt. So let them both ſléepe whiles I turne my penne vnto the before named <hi>Secretarie,</hi> who being (as I ſaye) come latelye from <hi>Florence,</hi> had made many proffers to renewe his accuſtomed conſultations: but the ſorrowe whiche his Miſtreſſe had conceyued in <hi>Ieronimy</hi> his ſickneſſe, togeather with hir continuall repayre to him during the ſame, had bene ſuch lettes vnto his attempts,

                  <p>At the laſt theſe newe accidentes fell ſo fauourably for the furtherance of his cauſe, that he came to his Miſtreſſe preſence and there pleaded for himſelfe.

At laſt two or thrée other gentlewomen of the Caſtle came into Madam <hi>Elinores</hi> chamber, who after their <hi>Bon iour</hi> did all <hi>(vna voce)</hi> ſéeme to lament the ſikenes of <hi>Ferdinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do</hi> and called vppon the Dames <hi>Elynor</hi> and <hi>Fraunces,</hi> to goe viſite him againe.</p>
                  <p>The Lady <hi>Fraunces</hi> curteouſly conſented, but Madame <hi>Elynor</hi> firſt alledged that ſhe her ſelfe was alſo ſickly, the
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:3023:247"/> which ſhe attributed to hir late paynes taken about him and ſayd, that onely for that cauſe ſhe was conſtrayned to kepe hir bed longer than hir accuſtomed hower. The Dames (but ſpecially the Lady <hi>Fraunces</hi>) gan ſtreight wayes coniecture ſome great cauſe of ſodaine chau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge, and ſo leauing dame <hi>Elinor,</hi> walked altogether into the parke to take the ayre in the morning: And as they thus walked it chau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ced that Dame <hi>Pergo</hi> heard a Cuckoe chaunt, who (becauſe the pride of the ſpring was now paſt) cried Cuck cuck Cuckoe in hir ſtamering voyce. A ha (quod <hi>Pergo</hi>) this foule byrd begines to flye the countrye, and yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hir departure, ſée how ſpitfully ſhe can deuyſe to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute vs. Not ſo (quod Dame <hi>Fraunces</hi>) but ſome other whom ſhe hath eſpyed, wherewith Dame <hi>Pergo</hi> looking round about hir, and eſpying none other companie ſayde. Why here is no body but we few women, <abbr>qd</abbr> ſhe. Thanks be to God the houſe is not farre from vs (quod Dame <hi>Fraunces.</hi>) Here at the wylie <hi>Pergo</hi> partly perceyuing Dame <hi>Fraunces</hi> meaning, replyed on this ſort: I vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand you not (quod ſhe) but to leap out of this matter, ſhall wée goe viſit Maiſter <hi>Ieronimy</hi> and ſee how he doth this morning. Why quod dame <hi>Fraunces,</hi> do you ſuppoſe that the Cuckoe called vnto him? Nay mary quod <hi>Pergo,</hi> for (as fare as I knowe) he is not maried. As who ſhould ſay (quod Dame <hi>Fraunces,</hi>) that the Cuckoe enuieth none but maryed folkes. I take it ſo, ſayd <hi>Pergo,</hi> the Lady <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi> anſwered. Yes ſure I haue noated as euill lucke in loue (after the Cuckoes call) to haue hapned vnto diuers vnmaried folkes, as euer I did vnto the maryed, but I can be well content that we go vnto him, for I promiſed on y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> behalfe of vs al, that we would vſe our beſt deuoyre to recomfort him vntill he had recouered helth: and I do much meruayle that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lady <hi>Elinor</hi> is now become ſo vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to take any trauayle in his behalfe, eſpecially re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring that but yeſternight ſhe was ſo diligent to
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:3023:247"/> bring him to bed. But I perceiue that all earthly thinges are ſubiect vnto change. Euen ſo they be quod <hi>Pergo,</hi> for you maye behold the trées which but euen this other daye were clad in gladſome gréene, and nowe their leaues be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to fade and change collour. Thus they paſſed talke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and walking vntill they returned vnto the Caſtle, whereas they went ſtrayght vnto <hi>Ferdinandoes</hi> chamber, and found him in bed. Why how now <hi>Trust</hi> (quod Dame <hi>Fraunces,</hi>) will it be no better? Yes ſhortly I hope quod he. The Ladyes all ſaluted him: and he gaue them the gra-mercy: at the laſt <hi>Pergo</hi> popped this queſtion vnto him: And howe haue you ſlept in your Miſtres ſhetes Mayſter <hi>Ieronemy</hi> quod ſhe? reaſonably well quod he, but I pray you where is my miſtreſſe this morning? Mary ſayd <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go,</hi> we left hir in bed ſcarce well at eaſe. I am the more ſorye quod he. Why <hi>Trust</hi> (ſayd Miſtreſſe <hi>Fraunces</hi> be of good comfort, &amp; aſſure your ſelfe that here are others who would be as glad of your wel doing, as your miſtres in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny reſpect. I ought not to doubt there of (quod <hi>Ferdina<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>do</hi>) hauing the profe that I haue had of your great courteſies, but I thought it my dutye to aſke for my miſtreſſe being abſent. Thus they paſſed ſome time with him vntill they were called awaye vnto prayers, and that being finiſhed they went to dinner, where they met Dame <hi>Elynor</hi> at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired in an night kerchiefe after the ſooleneſt (the ſolemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt faſhion I ſhould haue ſaid,) who loked very drowſely vpon all folkes, vnleſſe it were hir ſecretary, vnto whom ſhe deigned ſomtime to lend a frendly glaunce. The Lord of the Caſtle demaunded of hir how maſter <hi>Ieronemy</hi> did this morning. She anſwered that ſhe knew not for ſhe had not ſene him that day. You may do wel then daughter quod the Lord) to go now vnto him, and to aſſay if he will eate any thing, and if here be no meates that like him, I praye you commaunde (for him) anye thing that is in my houſe, You muſt pardon me ſir (quod ſhe,) I am ſickely
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:3023:248"/> diſpoſed, and would be loth to take the ayre, why then go you miſtres <hi>Fraunces</hi> (quod he) and take ſome body with you: and I charge you ſée that he lacke nothing. Miſtres <hi>Fraunces</hi> was glad of the ambaſſege, and aryſing from the table with one other gentleman, tooke with hir a diſh of chikins boiled in white broth, ſaying to hir father: I think this meat méeteſt for mayſter <hi>Ieronimy.</hi> Of any that is here. It is ſo (quod he) daughter, and if he like not that, cauſe ſome what els to be dreſſed for him according to his apetite. Thus ſhe departed and came to <hi>Ferdinando,</hi> who being plonged in ſundry woes and thrilled with reſtleſſe thoughtes, was nowe beginning to riſe. But ſeing the Dames, couched down agayne, and ſayd vnto them. Alas fayre Ladyes you put your ſelues to more paynes than eyther I do deſire, or can deſerue. Good <hi>Trust</hi> quod Dame <hi>Fraunces,</hi> our paynes are no greater than duty requireth, nor yet ſo great as we could vouchſafee in your behalfe. And preſently my father hath ſent vs vnto you (quod ſhe) with this pittaunce, and if your apetite deſire any on thing more than other, we are to deſire likewiſe that you will not refrayne to call for it. Oh my good <hi>Hope</hi> (quod he) I perceiue that I ſhall not dye as long as you maye make me liue. And being nowe ſome deale re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comforted with the remembraunce of his miſtres words which ſhe hadde vſed ouer night at hir firſt comming, and alſo thinkinge that although ſhee parted in choller, it was but iuſtlye prouoked by him ſelfe, and that at leaſure hee ſhoulde finde ſome ſalue for that ſore alſo) hée determined to take the comforte of his aſſured <hi>Hope,</hi> and ſo to expell all venomnes of miſtruſt before re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued. Wherfor raiſing him ſelfe in his bed, hee caſt a night gowne about his ſhoulders ſaying: It ſhall neuer be ſayd that my fainting hart can reiect the comfortable Cordialles of ſo freendly phiſitions. Nowe by me troth well ſayed gentle <hi>Trust</hi> quod Dame <hi>Fraunces,</hi> and in ſo
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:3023:248"/> doing, aſſure your ſelfe gueryſon with ſpéed. This thus ſayed, the curteous Dame become his keruer, &amp; he wyth a bold ſpirite gan taſt of hir cokerey. But the late conflicts of his conceipts had ſo diſaquainted his ſtomack from re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſtes, that he could not wel a way with meate: and yet neuertheleſſe by lyttle &amp; little receyued ſome nouryture. When his <hi>Hope</hi> had crammed him as longe as ſhe coulde make him ſéede, they delyuered the reſt to the other gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlewoman who hauing not dyned, fell to hir prouender. In which meane while the Lady <hi>Fraunces</hi> had much com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable ſpéech with <hi>ſignor Ieronemy</hi> and declared y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſhée perceiued very well the maladie. but my <hi>Trust</hi> (quod ſhe) be all whole, and remember what I foretould you in the beginning: neuertheleſſe you muſt thinke that there are remedies for all miſchifes, and if you will be ruled by myne aduiſe, we will ſoone finde the meane to eaſe you of this miſhap. <hi>Ferdinando</hi> tooke comforte in hir diſcrecion, &amp; fréendly kiſſed hir hand, gaue hir a cartlode of thankes for hir greate good will, promiſing to put to his vttermoſt force, and euermore to be ruled by hyr aduice. Thus they paſſed the dinner while, the Lady <hi>Fraunces</hi> alwayes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſing to declare hir conceipt of the late chaung which ſhe perceiued in his Miſtreſſe, for ſhe thought beſt firſt to wynne his wyll vnto conformitie, by little and little, and then in the ende to perſwade him with neceſſitye. When the other gentlewoman had vytayled hir, they departed, requiring him to riſe and boldly to reſiſt the faynteneſſe of his feuer. The which he promiſed and ſo bad them a <hi>Dio.</hi> The Ladyes at their retourne found the courte in Dame <hi>Elynores</hi> chamber, who had there aſſembled hir ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary, Dame <hi>Pergo</hi> &amp; the reſt: ther they paſſed an hower or twayne in ſundry diſcourſes, wherein Dame <hi>Pergo</hi> did alwaies caſt out ſome bone for miſtreſſe <hi>Fraunces</hi> to gnaw vppon, for that in déede ſhe perceyued hir harty af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection towardes <hi>Ferdinando</hi> whereat Miſtreſſe <hi>Fraunces</hi>
                     <pb n="260" facs="tcp:3023:249"/> chaunged no countenaunce, but reſerued hir reuenge vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till a better oportunitie. At laſt (quod Dame <hi>Fraunces</hi> vnto Miſtreſſe <hi>Elinor</hi>) and when will you goe vnto your ſeruaunt fayre Lady? When he is ſicke and I am whole, quod Dame <hi>Elinor.</hi> That is euen nowe quod the other, for howe ſicke he is your ſelfe can witneſſe: and howe well you are we muſt beare recorde. You maye as well be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued in my diſpoſition (quod Dame <hi>Elinor,</hi> as I was o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſéene in his ſodaine alteration: and if he be ſicke, you are meete to be his phiſition: for you ſawe yeſterday that my paines dyd lyttle profite towardes his recomfort. Yes ſurelye ſayde the other, not onelye I but all the reſt had occaſion to iudge that your curteſie was his chiefe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort. Well, quod Dame <hi>Elinor,</hi> you knowe not what I knowe. Nor you what I thinke quod Dame <hi>Fraun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</hi> Thinke what you lyſt quod <hi>Elinor.</hi> In deede quod <hi>Fraunces,</hi> I may not thinke that you care, neither wyll I dye for your diſpleaſure: &amp; ſo halfe angrie ſhe departed At ſupper they met againe, and the maiſter of the houſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded of his daughter <hi>Fraunces</hi> howe <hi>Fardinando</hi> did? Syr (quod ſhe) he dyd eate ſome what at dyner, and ſithens I ſawe him not. The more to blame quod he, and now I would haue al you gentlewomen take of the beſt meates and goe ſuppe with him, for company driueth away care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe, and leaue you me here with your leauinges a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone. Naye ſyr quod Miſtreſſe <hi>Elinor,</hi> I pray you giue me leaue to beare you company, for I dare not aduenture thither. The Lorde of the Caſtle was contented &amp; diſpat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched awaye the reſt: who taking with them ſuch viandes as they thought méeteſt, went vnto <hi>Ieronimies</hi> chamber, fynding him vp, and walking about to recouer ſtrength: whereat Dame <hi>Fraunces</hi> reioyſed, and declared how her Father had ſente that company to attend him at ſupper. <hi>Ferdinando</hi> gaue great thankes, &amp; miſſing now nothing but his Miſtreſſe, thought not good yet to aſke for hir, but
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:3023:249"/> becauſe he partly geſſed the cauſe of hir abſence, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented himſelfe, hoping that when his lure was newe garniſhed, he ſhoulde eaſely recleame hyr from thoſe coy conceyptes. They paſſed ouer their ſupper all in quyete, and ſone after Miſtreſſe <hi>Fraunces,</hi> being deſirous to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quite Dame <hi>Pargoes</hi> quibbes, requeſted that they might continue the paſtime which Dame <hi>Pergo</hi> had begonne o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer night: whervnto they all conſented, and the lot fell vnto Dame <hi>Fraunces</hi> to propounde the ſecond queſtion who adreſſing hir ſpeche vnto <hi>Ferdina<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>do</hi> ſaid in this wiſe, Noble gouernor, I will reherſe vnto you a ſtrange hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, not fayned, neyther borowed out of any oulde auctho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, but a thing done in deed of late dayes, and not farre diſtant from this place where wée nowe remayne. It chaunced that a gentleman our neyghbour being maryed to a very fayre gentlewoman, liued with hir by the ſpace of fower or fiue yeares in greate contentacion, truſting hir no leſſe than he loued hir, and yet louing hir as much as any man could loue a woman. On that other ſide the gentlewoman had woonne (vnto hir beautie) a ſingular commendation for hir chaſt and modeſt behauiour. Yet it happened in time that a luſtie young gentleman (who very often reſorted to them) obtayned that at hir handes, which neuer any man coulde before him attaine: and to be plaine, he wonne ſo much in hir affections, that forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting both hir owne duty, and hir huſbandes kindnes, ſhée yéelded hir body at the commaundement of this louer, in which paſtime they paſſed long tyme by theyr pollitycke gouernment. At laſt the frendes of this Lady (and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially thrée ſiſters which ſhe had) eſpied ouermuch fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milliarity betwene the two louers, and dreading leaſt it might breake out to their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon reproch toke their ſiſter apart, and declared that the world did iudge ſcarce well of the repayre of that Gentleman vnto hyr houſe: and that if ſhe did not foreſée it in time, ſhée ſhould not onely
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:3023:250"/> léeſe the good credite which ſhe hir ſelfe had hitherto poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed, but furthermore ſhould diſtaine theyr whole race with common obloquy &amp; reproche. Theſe and ſundry o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Godly admonitions of thoſe ſiſters, could not ſink in the mind of this gentlewoman, for ſhe dyd not only ſtand in defiaunce what any man could thinke of hir, but alſo ſéemed to accuſe them, that (becauſe they ſaw hir eſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion (being their yonger) to grow aboue their owne) they had therefore deuiſed this meane to ſet variance betwene hir huſbande and hir. The ſiſters ſeing their holeſome counſell ſo reiected, and hir continue ſtyll in hir obſtinate opinion, adreſſed theyr ſpeache vnto hir huſbande, decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring that the worlde iudged not the beſt, neyther they themſelues did very wel like of the familiaritie betwene their ſiſter and that gentleman, and therfore aduiſed him to forecaſt all perils, and in time to forbid him his houſe. The huſband (on the other ſide) had alſo conceiued ſuche a good opinion of his geſt, &amp; had growen into ſuch a ſtricte familliaritie with him, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> you might with more eaſe haue remoued a ſtone wal, than once to make him think amis, eyther of his wyfe, or of hir louer. Yea, and immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie after this conference, he woulde not ſticke thus to ſay vnto his wife. <hi>Lamia</hi> (for ſo in déede was hir name) thou haſt thrée ſuch buſie brained ſiſters, as I thinke ſhortlye their heads wyll breake: they woulde haue me to bée iel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous of thée, no no <hi>Lamia.</hi> &amp;c. ſo that he was not onely far from any ſuch beléefe, but furthermore dyd euerye daye increaſe his curteſies towards the louer. The ſiſters be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thus on all ſides reiected, and yet perceyuing more &amp; more an vnſéemelye behauiour betwéene their ſiſter and hir minion, began to melt in their owne greaſe: and ſuch was theyr enraged pretence of reuenge, that they ſubor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned diuers ſeruauntes in the houſe to watch ſo dilligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye, as that this treaſon might de diſcouered. Amongſt the reſt, one mayde of ſubtile ſpirite had ſo long watched
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:3023:250"/> them, that at laſt ſhe ſpied them go into the chamber toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and lockte the doore to them: wherevpon ſhe ranne with all haſt poſſible to hir Mayſter, and toold him that if he would come with hir, ſhe would ſhewe him a very ſtraunge ſighte. The gentleman (ſuſpecting nothing) went with hir, vntill he came into a chamber néere vnto that wherein they had ſhut themſelues. And ſhe pointing hir mayſter to the keyhole, bad him looke through, where he ſawe the thing which moſte mighte miſlike him to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold. Where at he ſodaynely drewe his Dagger, and tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned towardes the mayde, who fled from him for feare of miſchiefe. But when he could not ouertake hir in the heat of his coller, he commaunded that ſhe ſhould forth wyth truſſe vp that little which ſhe had, and to departe his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice. And before hir departure, he found meanes to talke with hir, threatening that if euer ſhe ſpake any worde of this miſtery in any place where ſhe ſhould come, it ſhould coſt hir life. The mayde for feare departed in ſilence, and the Maiſter neuer changed cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tenance to either his wife or to hir paramour, but fayned vnto his wife that he had turned a waye the mayde vpon that ſodayne, for that ſhee had throwen a Kitchin knife at him, whiles he went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to correct a fault in hir. &amp;c. Thus the good gentleman dranke vp his owne ſwette vnſeene euery day, encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing curteſie to the louer, and neuer chaunging counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunce to his wife in any thing, but onely that he refray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to haue ſuch knowledge of hir carnally, as he in tims paſt had, and other men haue of their wiues. In this ſort he continued by the ſpace all moſt of halfe a yeare, neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe lamenting his miſhap in ſolytary places. At laſt (what moued him I know not) he fell a gayn to company with his wife as other men do, and (as I haue heard it ſayed) he vſed this pollicy. Euery time that he had know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of hir, he would leaue either in the bed, or in hir cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhencloth, or by hir looking glaſſe, or in ſome place where
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:3023:251"/> ſhe muſt néedes finde it, a piece of money which then was in <hi>Italie</hi> called a <hi>Caroline.</hi> Thus he dealt with her conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuallye by the ſpace of fowre or fiue monethes, vſing hir neuertheleſſe very kindly in all other reſpects, and proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding for hir all things neceſſary at the firſt call. But vnto his geaſt he ſtill augmented his curteſie, in ſuch ſort, that you would haue thought them to be ſworne brothers. All this notwithſtanding his wife much muſing at theſe ſmal péeces which ſhe founde in this ſort, and furthermore, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing ſundrye times found hir huſband in ſolitarye places making great lamentation, ſhée grewe inquiſitiue, what ſhould be y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſecréete cauſe of theſe alterations, vnto whom he would none otherwiſe anſwere, but y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> any man ſhould finde occatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be more penſiue at one time than at ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. The wife notwithſtanding increaſing hir ſuſpect, imparted the ſame vnto hir louer, alledging therewithal that ſhe doubted verye much leaſt hir huſband had ſome veheme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t ſuſpicion of their affaires. The louer encoraged hir, &amp; likewiſe declared, that if ſhe would be importunate to enquire the cauſe, hir huſband would not be able to kepe it from hir: and hauing now throughly inſtructed hir, ſhée dealt with her huſband in this ſort. One day when ſhée knew him to be in his ſtudy alone, ſhe came into him, and hauing faſt locked the doore after hir, &amp; conueyed the keye into hir pocket, ſhe began firſt with earneſt entreaty, and then with teares to craue that he woulde no longer kéepe from hir the cauſe of his ſodaine alteration. The huſband diſſimuled the matter ſtill: at laſt ſhe was ſo earneſt to know for what cauſe he left money in ſuch ſort at ſundry times: That he aunſwered on this wiſe: Wyfe (quod hée) thou knoweſt howe long wée haue béene married togea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and howe long I made ſo deare accompt of thée as euer man made of his Wife: ſince which dayes, thou knoweſt alſo howe long I refrained thy company, and howe long againe I haue vſed thy company, leauing the
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:3023:251"/> money in this ſort, and the cauſe is this. So long as thou dyddeſt behaue thy ſelfe faithfullye towardes mée. I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer lothed thy company: but ſithens I haue perceiued thée to bée a harlotte, and therefore dyd I for a tyme refraine and forbeare to lye with thée, and nowe I can no longer forbeare it, I giue thée euery time that I lye with thée, a <hi>Caroline,</hi> which is to make thée vnder ſtande thine owne whordome: and this rewarde is ſufficient for a whore. The wife beganne ſtoutlye to ſtand at defiaunce, but the huſband cut of hir ſpeach, and declared when, where, and how he had ſene it: hereat the woman being abaſhed, and finding hir conſcience guilty of aſmuch as he had aledged, fell downe on hir knées, &amp; with moſt bitter teares craued pardon, confeſſing hir offence: whereat hir huſband (mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued with pitie) &amp; melting likewiſe in floods of lamentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, recomforted hir, promiſing that if from that day for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes ſhe would be true vnto him, he would not onely forgiue al that was paſt, but become more tender and lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing vnto hir then euer he was. What doe I tarrye ſo long? they became of accord: and in full accompliſhment thereof, the gentlewoman dyd altogeather eſchewe the company, the ſpeach, and (as much as in hir laye) the ſight of hir louer: although hir huſband dyd continue his curte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie towards him, and often charged his wife to make him fayre reſemblaunt. The Louer was nowe onelye left in perplexitie, who knewe nothing what might be the cauſe of all theſe chaunges, and that moſt gréeued him, he could by no meanes optaine againe the ſpeach of his deſired: he watched all opportunities, hée ſuborned meſſengers, hée wroote letters, but all in vaine. In the ende ſhe cauſed to bée declared vnto him a time and place where ſhe woulde méete him and ſpeake with him. Being met, ſhe put him in remembraunce of all that had paſſed betwéene them: ſhée layde alſo before him howe truſty ſhe had bene vnto him in all profeſſions: ſhe confeſſed alſo howe faithfullye
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:3023:252"/> he had diſcharged the duety of a friend in al reſpectes, and therwithall ſhe declared that her late alteration and pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiueneſſe of minde was not without great cauſe, for that ſhe had of late ſuch a miſhap, as might chaunge the diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of any lyuing creature: Yea, and that the caſe was ſuch, as vnleſſe ſhe found preſent remedy, hir death muſt needes enſue, and that ſpedely, for the preuenting where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, ſhe alledged that ſhe had beaten hir braines with al de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſes poſſible, and that in the ende ſhe could thinke of no redreſſe but one, the which lay only in him to acompliſh. Wherfore ſhe beſought him for all the loue and good will which had euer paſſed betwéene them, nowe to ſhewe the fruites of true friendſhip, and to gratifie hir with a frée graunt to this requeſt. The louer who had alwayes bene deſirous to pleaſure hir in any thing, but now eſpecially to recouer hir wonted kindneſſe, gan franklye promiſe to accompliſhe any thing that might be to him poſſible, yea, though it were to his great detriment, and therewithall, dyd déepely blame hir in that ſhée would ſo long torment hir ſelfe with any griefe, conſidering that it lay in him to helpe it. The Ladye aunſwered, that ſhe had ſo long kept it from his knowledge, bicauſe ſhe doubted whether hée would be content to performe it or not, although it was ſuch a thing as he might eaſely graunt without any man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of hurt to himſelf, &amp; yet now in the ende ſhe was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to aduenture vppon his curteſie, being no longer able to beare y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> burde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of hir griefe: the louer ſolicited her moſt earneſtly to diſcloſe it: and ſhe (as faſt) ſéemed to miſtruſt that he would not accompliſh it. In the ende ſhe tooke out a booke (which ſhe had brought for the nonce) &amp; bound him by othe to accompliſhe it. The louer miſtruſting nothing leſſe tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that enſued, toke the othe willingly, which done, ſhe declared al that had paſſed betwene hir &amp; hir huſband: his griefe, hir repentance, his pardon, hir vowe, and in the ende of hir tale enioyned the louer, that from thenceforth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes,
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:3023:252"/> he ſhould neuer attempt to breake her conſtant determinatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, the louer replied that this was vnpoſſible. But ſhe plainlye aſſured him, that if he graunted hir that requeſt, ſhe would be his friend in al honeſt &amp; godly wiſe: if not, ſhe put him out of doubt that ſhe would eſchew his company and flée from his ſight as from a ſcorpion. The louer conſidering that hir requeſt was but iuſt, accuſing his owne guiltye conſcience, remembring the great cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſies alwayes vſed by hir huſband, and therewithall ſée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the caſe now brought to ſuch an iſſue, as that by no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther meanes than by this it could be conceiled from the knowledge of the worlde: but moſt of all, being vrged by his othe, dyd at laſt giue an vnwilling conſent, and yet a faithful promiſe to yelde vnto hir wyl in al thinges, and thus being become of one aſſent, he remaineth the dereſt friend &amp; moſt welcome geſt that may be, both to the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and hir huſband: and the man and the wife ſo kind (each to other) as if there neuer had bene ſuch a breche betwen them. Now, of you noble Gouernor I would faine lerne, whether the perplexity of the huſband when he looked in at the keye hoole, or of the wife when ſhe knewe the cauſe why the <hi>Carolines</hi> were ſo ſcattered, or of the louer when he knew what was his miſtres charge, was greater of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> thrée? I might haue put in alſo y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> troubled thoughts of the ſiſters &amp; the mayd, when they ſaw their good wil reiected, but let theſe thrée ſuffice. Gentle <hi>Hope</hi> (quod <hi>Ferdinando</hi>) you haue rehearſed (&amp; that right eloque<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly) a notable tale, or rather a notable hiſtory, becauſe you ſéeme to affirme, that is was done in dede of late &amp; not far hence. Wherein I note fiue eſpecial pointes: that is a maruailous patience in the huſband, no leſſe repentaunce in the wife, no ſmal boldneſſe of the mayde, but muche more raſhneſſe in the ſiſters, &amp; laſt of al, a rare tractabilitie in the louer. Neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe ſo returne vnto your queſtion. I thinke the huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands perplexity greateſt, becauſe his loſſes abounded a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:3023:253"/> the reſt, &amp; his iniuries were vnco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>parable. The La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy <hi>Fraunces</hi> did not ſeme to contrary him but rather ſmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in hir ſléeue at Dame <hi>Pergo,</hi> who had no leſſe patience to here the tale recited, then the Lady <hi>Fraunces</hi> had plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in telling of it. By this time the ſléeping houre apro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, &amp; the Ladyes prepared their departure, when as mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtres <hi>Frau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces</hi> ſayd vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
                     <hi>Venetiane:</hi> Although percaſe I ſhall not do it ſo ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dſomly as your miſtres, yet good <hi>Trust</hi> (quod ſhe) if you vouchſafe it, I can be content to trim vp your bed in the beſt maner that I may, as on who would be as glad as ſhe to procure your quiet reſt. <hi>Ferdinando</hi> gaue hir great tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ks deſiring hir not to trouble hirſelf, but to let his man alone with y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> charge. Thus they departed, &amp; how al partyes toke reſt that night I knowe not: but in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> morning <hi>Ferdinando</hi> began to conſider with himſelfe that he might lye long ynough in his bed before his miſtres would be apeaſed in hir peuiſhe conceipts: wherfore he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſe, &amp; being aparelled in his night gowne, tooke occation to walke in the gallery néere adioyning vnto his miſtres chamber: but there might he walke long inough ere his Miſtreſſe would come to walke with him. When dinner time came he went into the great chamber whereas the Lord of the Caſtle ſaluted him, being ioyful of his recoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye: <hi>Ieronimy</hi> giuing due thanks, declared that his frie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dly entertainement togeather with the great curteſie of the gentlewomen was ſuch, as might reuiue a man although he were halfe dead. I would bée loath (quod the hoaſt) that any Gentleman comming to mee for good wyll, ſhoulde want any curteſie of intertainement that lyeth in my power. When the meate was ſerued to the table, the Gentlewomen came in all but Dame <hi>Elynor</hi> and Miſtreſſe <hi>Pergo,</hi> the which <hi>Ferdinando</hi> marked very well, and it dyd ſomewhat abate his apetite. After diner, his <hi>Hope</hi> came vnto him and demaunded of him howe hée would paſſe the daye for his recreation? to whome he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered euen as it beſt pleaſed hir. She deuiſed to walke
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:3023:253"/> into the parke, and ſo by litle and litle to acquaint himſelf with the ayre: he agréed, and they walked togeather being accompanied with one or two other gentle women. And although there were nowe more cauſe that hee ſhoulde miſtruſt his Miſtreſſe than euer he had before receyued, yet the vehement paſſions which he ſawe in her when ſhe firſt came to viſite him, and moreouer the earneſt words which ſhe pronounced in his extremitie, were ſuch a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhing to his minde, as that he determined no more to trouble him ſelfe with like conceiptes: concluding fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that if his miſtreſſe were not faultie, then had he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted a foule offence in néedeles ielouſie, and that if ſhe were faultie (eſpeciallye with the <hi>Secretarie</hi>) then no per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwation could amend hir, nor any paſſion helpe him? and this was the cauſe that enabled him after ſuche paſſing panges to abide the doubtfull concluſion: And thus man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully and valiantly to repreſſe faintneſſe of his mind: no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing doubting but that he ſhould haue won his miſtreſſe to pardon his preſumption, &amp; louingly to imbrace his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice in wonted maner: but he was farre deceiued, for ſhée was nowe in a nother tewne, the which Miſtreſſe <hi>Fraun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi> began partly to diſcouer vnto him as they walked to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geather: for ſhe burdened him that his mallady proceded onely of a diſquiet minde. And if it dyd ſo my gentle <hi>Hope</hi> (quod he) what remedy? My good <hi>Truſt</hi> (quod ſhe) none o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther but to plant quiet where diſquiet began to grow. I haue determined (quod he) but I muſt craue the helpe of your aſſured friendſhip. Therof you may make accompt (quod ſhe) but wherein? <hi>Ferdinando</hi> walking apart with hir, began to declare that there was ſome contention ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened betwéene his miſtres and him: the Lady tolde him that ſhe was not ignoraunt thereof. Then he deſired hir to treate ſo much in the cauſe, as they might eftſons come to <hi>Parlee:</hi> thereof I dare aſſure you (quod Miſtreſſe <hi>Fraun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi>) and at their returne ſhe led him into his Miſtreſſe
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:3023:254"/> Chamber, whome they founde lying on hir bed, whether gauled with any griefe, or weary of the thing (which you woote of) I know not, but there ſhe lay: vnto whome <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinando</hi> gaue two or thrée ſalutations before ſhe ſeemed to marke him. At laſt ſayd the Lady <hi>Fraunces</hi> vnto hir, your ſeruaunt hearing of your ſickneſſe, hath aduentured thus far into the ayre to ſee you. I thank him (quod dame <hi>Elinor</hi>) &amp; ſo lay ſtill, refuſing to giue him any countena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce. Whereat he perceiuing all the other Gentlewomen fall to whiſpering, thought good, boldlye to pleade his owne caſe: and approching the bed began to enforce his vnwyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Miſtreſſe vnto curteſie, wherein he vſed ſuch vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mence as ſhe could not wel by any meanes refuſe to talk with him: but what their talke was, I may not take vpon me to tel you. Sufficeth this to be known, that in the end ſhe pretended to paſſe ouer all olde grudges, and thence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foorth to pleaſuure him as occation might ſerue, the which occation was ſo long in hapening, that in the ende he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nowe eftſones troubled with vnquiet fantaſies, and forced to vſe his penne againe as an Ambaſſadour be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twéene them: one daye amongſt the reſt f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <figure/>
                  <l>No wight in this world, that wealth can attayne,</l>

                  <l>Vnleſſe he beleue, that all is but vayne.</l>
                  <p>Alſo our father <hi>Chaucer</hi> hath vſed the ſame libertie in féete and meaſures that the Latiniſts do vſe: and who ſo euer do peruſe and well conſider his workes, he ſhall finde that although his lines are not alwayes of one ſelfe ſame number of Syllables, yet beyng redde by one that hath vnderſtanding, the longeſt verſe and that which hath moſt Syllables in it, will fall (to the eare) correſpondent vnto that whiche hath feweſt ſillables in it: and like wiſe that whiche hath in it feweſt ſyllables, ſhalbe founde yet to conſiſt of woordes that haue ſuche naturall ſounde, as may ſéeme equall in length to a verſe which hath many moe ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lables of lighter accentes. And ſurely I can lament that wee are fallen into ſuche a playne and ſimple manner of wryting, that there is none other foote vſed but one: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by our Poemes may iuſtly be called Rithmes, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not by any right challenge the name of a Verſe. But ſince it is ſo, let vs take the forde as we finde it, and lette me ſet downe vnto you ſuche rules or precepts that euen in this playne foote of two ſyllables you wreſte no woorde from his natural and vſuall ſounde, I do not meane hereby that you may vſe none other wordes but of twoo ſillables, for therein you may vſe diſcretion according to occaſion of matter: but my meaning is, that all the wordes in your verſe be ſo placed as the firſt ſillable may ſound ſhort or be depreſſed, the ſecond long or eleuate, the third ſhorte, the fourth long, the fifth ſhorte, &amp;c. For example of my mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in this point marke theſe two verſes:</p>
                  <figure/>

                  <p>In theſe two verſes there ſéemeth no difference at all, ſince the one hath the very ſelfe ſame woordes that the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath, and yet the latter verſe is neyther true nor plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant, &amp; the firſt verſe may paſſe the muſters. The fault of the latter verſe is that this worde <hi>vnderſtand</hi> is therein ſo placed as the graue accent falleth vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
                     <hi>der,</hi> and therby ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth <hi>der,</hi> in this worde vnderſtand to be eleuated: which is contrarie to the naturall or vſual pronu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ciation: for we ſay</p>

                  <l>

                     <hi>5</hi> Here by the way I thinke it not amiſſe to forewarne you that you thruſt as few wordes of many ſillables into your verſe as may be: and herevnto I might alledge ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny reaſons: firſt the moſt auncient Engliſh wordes are of one ſillable, ſo that the more monaſyllables that you vſe, the truer Engliſhman you ſhall ſéeme, and the leſſe you ſhall ſmell of the Inkehorne. Alſo wordes of many ſylla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles do cloye a verſe and make it vnpleaſant, whereas woordes of one ſyllable will more eaſily fall to be ſhorte or long as occaſion requireth, or wilbe adapted to become cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumflexe or of an indifferent ſounde.</p>

                     <hi>6</hi> I would exhorte you alſo to beware of rime without reaſon: my meaning is hereby that your rime leade you not from your firſte Inuention, for many wryters when they haue layed the platforme of their inuention, are yet drawen ſometimes (by ryme) to forget it or at leaſt to alter it, as when they cannot readily finde out a worde whiche maye rime to the firſt (and yet continue their determinate Inuention) they do then eyther botche it vp with a worde that will ryme (howe ſmall reaſon ſoeuer it carie with it) or els they alter their firſt worde and ſo percaſe decline or trouble their former Inuention: But do you alwayes hold your firſt determined Inuention, and do rather ſearche the bottome of your braynes for apte wordes, than chaunge good reaſon for rumbling rime.</p>

                     <hi>14</hi> And here bycauſe I haue named Rithme royall, I will tell you alſo mine opinion aſwell of that as of the names which other rymes haue commonly borne hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. Rythme royall is a verſe of tenne ſillables, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen ſuch verſes make a ſtaffe, whereof the firſt and thirde lines do aunſwer (acroſſe) in like terminations and rime, the ſecond, fourth, and fifth, do likewiſe anſwere eche other in terminations, and the two laſt do combine and ſhut vp the Sentence: this hath bene called Rithme royall, &amp; ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it is a royall kinde of verſe, ſeruing beſt for graue diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes. There is alſo another kinde called Ballade, and thereof are ſundrie ſortes: for a man may write ballade in a ſtaffe of ſixe lines, euery line conteyning eighte or ſixe ſillables, whereof the firſte and third, ſecond and fourth do rime acroſſe, and the fifth and ſixth do rime togither in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion. You may write alſo your ballad of tenne ſillables rimyng as before is declared, but theſe two were wont to be moſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly vſed in ballade, which propre name was (I thinke) deriued of this worde in Italian <hi>Ballare,</hi> whiche ſignifieth to daunce. And in deed thoſe kinds of rimes ſerue beſte for daunces or light matters. Then haue you alſo a rondlette, the which doth alwayes end with one ſelf ſame foote or repeticion, and was thereof (in my iudgement) cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a rondelet. This may conſiſt of ſuch meaſure as beſt li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth the wryter, then haue you Sonnets, ſome thinke that all Poemes (being ſhort) may be called Sonets, as in déede it is a diminutiue worde deriued of <hi>Sonare,</hi> but yet I can beſte allowe to call thoſe Sonets whiche are of fouretene lynes, euery line conteyning tenne ſyllables. The firſte twelue do ryme in ſtaues of foure lines by croſſe méetre, and the laſt twoo ryming togither do conclude the whole
<pb facs="tcp:3023:268"/> There are Dyzaynes, &amp; Syxaines which are of ten lines, and of ſixe lines, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly vſed by the French, which ſome Engliſh writers do alſo terme by the name of Sonettes. Then is there an old kinde of Rithme called Verlayes, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riued (as I haue redde) of this worde <hi>Verd</hi> whiche betoke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth Gréene, and <hi>Laye</hi> which betokeneth a Song, as if you would ſay gréene Songes: but I muſte tell you by the way, that I neuer redde any verſe which I ſaw by auctho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie called <hi>Verlay,</hi> but one, and that was a long diſcourſe in verſes of tenne ſillables, whereof the foure firſt did ryme acroſſe, and the fifth did aunſwere to the firſte and thirde, breaking off there, and ſo going on to another termination, Of this I could ſhewe example of imitation in mine own verſes written to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> right honorable y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lord <hi>Grey</hi> of <hi>VVil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> vpon my iourney into <hi>Holland,</hi> &amp;c. There are alſo cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine Poemes deuiſed of tenne ſyllables, whereof the firſt aunſwereth in termination with the fourth, and the ſecond and thirde anſwere eche other: theſe are more vſed by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther nations than by vs, neyther can I tell readily what name to giue them.

Then to returne too my matter, as this riding rime ſerueth moſt aptly to wryte a merie tale, ſo Rythme royall is fitteſt for a graue diſcourſe. Ballades are beſte of matters of loue, and rondlettes moſte apt for the beating or handlyng of an adage or common prouerbe: Sonets ſerue aſwell in matters of loue as of diſcourſe: Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zaymes and Sixames for ſhorte Fantazies: Verlayes for an effectuall propoſition, although by the name you might otherwiſe iudge of Verlayes, and the long verſe of twelue and fouretene ſillables, although it be now adayes vſed in all Theames, yet in my iudgement it would ſerue beſt for Pſalmes and Himpnes.</p>
