            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hat I at firſt intended for mine owne imployment to paſſe away ſpare time, and afterward purpoſed for your pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate exerciſe onely, is now made pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique not by my free and voluntarie e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection; but by an accident of neare nature to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint. For hauing hastily finiſhed the tranſlation of theſe two firſt comedies of <hi>Terence,</hi> and ended the foure firſt acts of the third, I miſſed my booke one alone day, and then found it againe gelded of the three Latter Acts of the third Comedie. Shortly after I met the Copie thereof in the hands of a Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioner: whence I coniectured that my booke had been copied out by character for ſale; and that done by ſome lame and ignorant Author, who was not able to be his owne diſcipherer. I had neglected this thiefe, this plagiarie; and had ſuffered him to make vſe of my labour, but that one honeſt and learned gentleman had ſeene my doings in <hi>Andria,</hi> and who alſo knew I was about the reſidue. You apprehend the iust reaſon of this publication. As touching my
<pb facs="tcp:3145:3"/>Dedication, I do not ſo much doubt the imputation of careleſneſſe of my credit in ſeeking Patronage from raw and greene youth, as I feare the challenge of ambitiouſneſſe in prouiding Patrons, who are to ſtand vp in all ſucceſſion of times ſo long as your Schooles foundation ſhall continue: and ſome of you being likely very ſhortly to become of moſt full abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie to defend your vnknowne Client. But till you arriue at ſuch maturitie, giue me leaue to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine my ſelfe, and to prepare you.</p>
            <p>I haue alreadie heard ſomewhat, whereby I further ſuſpect how I may be further quarelled. There will perhaps ſome be found who on their good faiths will proteſt that this generall licentiouſneſſe of turning Latine bookes into Engliſh, caries with it much inconuenience. I hope in the generall looſeneſſe they include not thoſe extant tranſlations of <hi>Liuy, Plinie, Plutarch, Suetonius, Tacitus,</hi> and the like Authors: if they meane onley ſuch verſions as was that of <hi>Ouids</hi> Art of loue, &amp; the like bookes tending to corruption of youth, I will ioyne with them; and adde, that ſuch tranſlations are not onely inconue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient but impious alſo. But in <hi>Terence</hi> is no ſuch danger. In thoſe few paſſages where his matter beares any ranke ſent or ſence, you ſhall find it huſhed by ſome modest cloſe <hi>Eclipſie,</hi> or ſtopping <hi>Apoſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſis;</hi> or elſe couched vnder ſuch darke and miſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call termes, as the young ſcholler cannot apprehend to any danger of defiling: which courſe I haue alſo
<pb facs="tcp:3145:3"/>purſued. Beſides <hi>Terence</hi> (as I heard) hath for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly beene Engliſhed and publiſhed: ſo that this way I might decline the crime, of first turning him into our tongues, but becauſe I neuer ſaw that En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh Author, and therefore know not how he hath carried it, I dare not ſhelter my ſelfe vnder ſuch precedent: but I dare venture to ſhare with <hi>Theod. Beza</hi> in any hazard of this imputation; and let ſuch Cauillers know, that they by this aſperſion ſhall bee found to wound that learned Frenchman through my ſides: for his tranſlation is extant, imprinted in French on one ſide and in Latine on the other ſide of euery leafe: and is now in the handes of all young ſchollers, throughout the whole French King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. From the matter of the tranſlation I come to the manner, and therein do foreſee, that it may be obiected, that where <hi>Terence</hi> many times vſeth generall tearmes, I do ſo raſhly perticularlize him, places that in many places I retaine not the purpoſe &amp; meaning of my Author; and againe, that in ſome my Engliſh doth not render the Latine truly: by the firſt they would inforce, that I conceaue not the drift and ſcope of my Author; by the later that I vnderſtand not his words. I will onely giue you two or three inſtances, the better to prepare you to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend the rest. <hi>An. Act. 1. Sc. 1. ver. 3. Curentur haec</hi> that theſe things be well ordered or looked too, I in ſpecial tearmes thus reſtraine, that theſe things be well cooked; hauing relation to <hi>Iſthaec intrò au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferte</hi>

               <pb facs="tcp:3145:5"/>going before, where I vnderstand <hi>Iſthaec</hi> to be meant of prouiſion for a diſſembled wedding ſupper. Here it may be oppoſed by ſome, not out of their owne braines or conceipt, but by arguments filched out of blinde and ignorant Authors, that I am be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide the cuſhion. I am not ignorant of three reaſons vſed aboue a hundred yeares agoe against this inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation. Firſt it is ſaid that <hi>Auferre</hi> is a word denoting things contemptible, and therefore cannot be meant of Cates or dainties of diet. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, it is affirmed that here was no ſuch pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſion made as would require theſe ſeruants to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie in: and this they ground on the words of <hi>Dauus Act. 2. Scen. 2. Paululum obſonij.</hi> And againe, <hi>Act. 2. Scen. 6. Vix drachmis inquit obſonatus eſt decem.</hi> Thirdly, they vrge the old French printed bookes, where by the pictures expreſſing the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of euery Scene certaine logges or billets are ſigured, and not baskets with prouiſion from the market. Whence they would inferre that by <hi>Iſthaec</hi> no feaſting ſtuffe is intended but matter of fewell onely. Perceiue you not the blockiſh conceipt of theſe loggerhead arguers? ſtay a while; and perhaps I ſhall affoord you meanes, better to vnderstand the matter. First, therefore I confeſſe and auoid the argument of contempt: for though <hi>Auferre</hi> (accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to <hi>Donat</hi>) be commonly vſed of things ſpoken of with diſdaine, yet not alwayes ſo; for that which <hi>Terence</hi> meant by <hi>Auferte iſthaec</hi> in the firſt line, is
<pb facs="tcp:3145:5"/>named <hi>Curentur haec</hi> in the third: Now <hi>Curatio</hi> in its proper notion is <hi>Medicinae, aut (quae eſt eius famula) coquinae;</hi> and cannot be ſaid of any thing whereof we ſpeake with diſdaine or loathing. <hi>Dauus</hi> words proue nothing: they only extenuate, do not deny the prouiſion. And for the French pictures. Painters and Poets (you know) take much libertie: but for anſwer I ſay, that <hi>Aſcenſius</hi> a learned Critique, great Grammarian and famous Printer aboue <hi>100.</hi> yeares ago in France, and ſo beſt able to determine, the doubt, taking vpon him to argue the queſtion, hath left the matter indifferent: yet inclines ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to <hi>Edulia</hi> then <hi>ligna.</hi> And me thinks ſuch inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation may be euinced by euidence of reaſons; for beſides that a wedding was ſtrongly to be borne vp (this could not handſomely be carried without a feast) it is manifest that <hi>Simo</hi> came from the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket: for ſo <hi>Pamphilus, Act. 1. Scen. 5. Pater prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriens modò apud forum.</hi> Did theſe ſernants at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend <hi>Simo</hi> thence with billets or bauins on their ſhoulders? this construction were as ridiculous, as improbable that a man of <hi>Simo's</hi> eſtate whoſe ſonne was worthy to receiue tenne talents in portion with a wife, <hi>Act. 5. Scen. 4.</hi> ſhould be vnfurniſhed of ſuch ordinarie prouiſion. Or came theſe ſeruants emptie home after <hi>Simo?</hi> and were appointed to carrie in logges and fagots then lying before their Maſters doore? this coniecture is as abſurd; for how came the wood there? why did it trouble the ſtage? or
<pb facs="tcp:3145:6"/>which way might it concerne the Argument? Eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially why ſhould <hi>Soſia</hi> formerly made free, now ſuſpect that his Maſter <hi>Simo</hi> would <hi>Mutare factu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>;</hi> and recall him to a ſecond bondage, by impoſing vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him ſuch ſlauiſh drudgerie as <hi>Curare focum;</hi> a ſcullions no freed mans office? what art needed here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to? and <hi>Soſia</hi> tenders imployment of art in the words immediately following <hi>Quid eſt, quod ars mea tibi efficere poſſit amplius?</hi> Indeed to ſteward a feast had in it ſome art, and ſeemes to haue beene a part of freed mens imployments, <hi>Eunuch, Act. 3. Scen. 5. ver. 60.</hi> Thus I hope I haue giuen you ſome reaſon of this interpretation. Beſides <hi>Guido</hi> hath long ago ſo construed it, viz. <hi>Anno Dom. 1497.</hi> and <hi>Aſcenſius</hi> reuiewing <hi>Guido</hi> &amp; in many places cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting him, hath yet herein againſt his owne french printed copies allowed him, at leſt left it indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent. I told you before I had heard ſomewhat: it was of him in whoſe hands I met with my adulterate copie. This man charged the booke with many foule errors, and that iuſtly: One thing he taxed which was mine owne; yet which I durſt not maintaine, for feare of giuing ſuſpicion that I was father of the rest. <hi>Ander. Act. 2. Scen. 2.</hi> The words were <hi>Olera &amp; piſciculos portantem in coenam ſeni,</hi> Which I render with hearbes and ſmall ſprots for the old mans ſupper: The challenge was, that the doer tooke <hi>Piſciculus</hi> to be Latine for the ſprot; beſide (ſaid he) it would be conſidered whether this fiſh were to bee
<pb facs="tcp:3145:6"/>found in the Attick ſeas.

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Here were two brethren Citizens of Athens, the one called <hi>Chremes</hi> the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Phania. Chremes</hi> being to trauell into Aſia left the charge of his then onely daughter <hi>Baſibula</hi> an infant with his brother <hi>Phania.</hi> Shortly after his departure out of Attica, <hi>Phania</hi> alſo to auoid the rage of warre growing hot in Greece, ſhipped himſelfe thence with his little niece, directing his courſe towards the place where he ſuppoſed <hi>Chremes</hi> aboad: but ſuffering ſhipwracke was caſt with the little one, vpon the ſhoare of the Iſle of Andros, where getting entertainement of a poore Iſlander he ſhortly after died. His hoſt after his deceaſe, changeth the childs name from <hi>Paſibula</hi> into <hi>Glycerium;</hi> and hauing bred her vp for ſome yeares in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall education with his owne naturall child called <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis,</hi> himſelfe alſo dyeth. <hi>Chremes</hi> in the <hi>Interim</hi> had returned to Athens, and there had another daughter named <hi>Philu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mena:</hi> And all this while ſuppoſed his brother and his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther daughter to haue long ſince periſhed at ſea. <hi>Chriſis</hi> being left fatherleſſe and poore leaues <hi>Andros,</hi> and taking <hi>Glycerium</hi> with her ſailes to Athens; where they dwell to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether as reputed ſiſters. <hi>Chriſis</hi> turnes harlot: her louers draw along with them to her houſe one <hi>Pamphilus</hi> ſonne of <hi>Simo</hi> an antient Athenian Citizen. <hi>Pamphilus</hi> falling in loue with <hi>Glycerium</hi> gets her with child, and affianceth
<pb facs="tcp:3145:8"/>himſelfe to her. <hi>Chremes</hi> vpon a publique fame of <hi>Pamphi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi> his vertues treates with <hi>Simo</hi> for a match betweene their children <hi>Pamphilus</hi> and <hi>Philumena:</hi> and a marriage is agreed vpon betweene the two old fathers, <hi>Pamphilus</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not made acquainted. <hi>Chryſis</hi> ſoone after dies, at whoſe funerals <hi>Pamphilus</hi> occaſionally diſcouered ſignes of very ardent affection to <hi>Glycerium;</hi> which <hi>Chremes</hi> hearing of, renounceth him for ſonne in law as one apparantly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſotted and intangled with extraordinarie loue to a ſtrag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling ſtrumpet (ſo ignorantly he ſtiled the iſſue of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per loynes) <hi>Pamphilus</hi> (now firſt hearing of the determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned match) is glad ſuch marriage is diſappointed. <hi>Simo</hi> frets at it. And now is the prefixed day of marriage come, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the day containing the argument of this Coinedie. <hi>Simo</hi> makes ſhew to all the people of his familie, as if the marriage were on this day to be ſolemnized, and this he did out of a foxlike ſubtiltie to feele his ſonnes inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to marriage, and vpon his refuſall to haue iuſt occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of complaint againſt him, which hitherto he had not. And if his ſonne ſhould declare readineſſe to entertaine the match, he then thought it would proue no ſuch diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult matter to cuerrule <hi>Chremes;</hi> and ſo the buſineſſe to go on as it was firſt determined. <hi>Simo</hi> hauing thus proie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted matters, meets his ſonne; and wils him to pray to the gods for ſucceſſe vpon his marriage inſtantly to bee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed. The ſonne at his fathers ſalutation ſtands thunderſtrucken, ignorant what courſe to take for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uention. <hi>Dauus</hi> comes to him in this diſtraction, at what time one <hi>Charinus</hi> was with him. This <hi>Charinus</hi> was a yong man inflamed with the loue of <hi>Philumena,</hi> the intended bride; and was now in a manner deſperate, when he vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood that <hi>Pamphilus</hi> was that day to marrie her: <hi>Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>philus</hi> aſſuers him of his purpoſed reſolution to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie. This was the theame of their diſcourſe when <hi>Dauus</hi> came vpon them. <hi>Dauus</hi> (now) was <hi>Simoes</hi> ſeruant, a fellow
<pb facs="tcp:3145:9"/>of good reach: and he vpon grounds reaſonable had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued his old maſters fetch in this pretended marriage, which (hauing ſent away <hi>Charinus</hi>) he opens to <hi>Pamphilus:</hi> reſoluing him that in all likelihood the old man did but caſt out a hooke to catch at his inclination to <hi>Glycerium:</hi> wiſhing him therefore without all ſcruple to promiſe his father all obedience and readineſſe in imbracing this fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced marriage; he further intimates, that no hazard was likely hereby to inſue: for that <hi>Chremes</hi> hauing once open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly refuſed him, would not (at leaſt ſo ſuddenly) intertaine him for a ſonne in law. <hi>Pamphilus</hi> puts the aduice in exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution. <hi>Simo</hi> and <hi>Dauus</hi> venter either of them vpon the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard, but <hi>Simo</hi> his lucke carries it. For <hi>Chremes</hi> is wonne to a new conſent, and now is <hi>Pamphilus</hi> in danger to bee caſt vpon a preſent marriage, where hee neuer intended. What may <hi>Dauus</hi> how do? author of a counſell not ſo vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely as vnluckie? Chance preſents him occaſion, and he hath good braine to make vſe of the leaſt offered occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: what is that? <hi>Glycerium</hi> is brought to bed: the new borne child is by her maid, but by <hi>Dauus</hi> direction) laid at <hi>Simo's</hi> doore: and this is done iuſt when <hi>Chremes</hi> muſt of neceſſitie ſee it: <hi>Dauus</hi> further ſo carries the matter, that <hi>Chremes</hi> vnderſtands who is father, who is mother to the child. Theſe things inſtly mone <hi>Chremes</hi> to a ſecond re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nunciation: Hence great ſtirie ariſeth: <hi>Crito</hi> a man of <hi>Andros</hi> (arriued at Athens vpon newes of <hi>Cryſis</hi> her death, being next heire to her eſtate) ends all; by diſcovering <hi>Glyceriums</hi> freedome &amp; parentage. <hi>Pamphilus</hi> marries <hi>Gly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerium</hi> now againe knowne by her firſt name <hi>Paſibula; Charinus</hi> marries the other ſiſter <hi>Philumena.</hi>

After this the Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian died. The Pyrats ſold the child to a Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant of Rhodes, who gaue her to a Strumpet which he loued. This Harlot had a daughter called <hi>Thais,</hi> ſomewhat elder then <hi>Pamphila:</hi> Which children ſhe ſo brought vp together, that all men of Rhodes did repute them for Siſters. <hi>Thais</hi> in proceſſe of time tooke to her mothers trade of life; and yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding vp her ſelfe to a ſtrangers deuotion, was by him caried to Athens; where he dying left her good means. He thus dead, ſhe was taken vp by one <hi>Thraſo</hi> aſouldier: he alſo hauing a while accompanied her, had occaſion of trauaile into Caria. Meane while
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:3145:36"/>the mother of <hi>Thais</hi> died at Rhodes: Her goods fell to a brother, who (with them) expoſed to ſale the abouenamed <hi>Pamphila,</hi> iust vpon the time where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the ſoldier paſſed that way. Her youth and beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie induced the ſouldier (ignorant of all paſſages) to buy her, as a fit gift to beſtow on <hi>Thais</hi> at his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne to Athens. But ſhe before that time (whores do not liue in expectation, nor vpon the meanes of one man onely) had intertaind the loue of one <hi>Phaedria</hi> a young gentleman, ſonne of an ancient Athenian Citizen. She alſo had by this time gained ſome inkling of the parentage of <hi>Pamphila,</hi> and that one <hi>Chremes</hi> a genteleman of Athens was in good likelihood uaturall brother to the maiden: for better diſcouery whereof, ſhe had had conference with him (a loofe off) touching the matter.
