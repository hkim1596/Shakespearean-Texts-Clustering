            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

haue, at the foot of the out-ſide of the Hill, dig'd forth an entrance, and vnderneath haue made a Vault which reaches iuſt to the banke of the Riuer, all along the ſide of which, they haue made a many trap-doores, and ſo when a man has heard enough, they vnbolt the trap-doores within, and let him ſlide downe gently.</p>

and ſo decline the preſent violence of the ſeaſon: and as in an arbour vnto which the Sun has acceſſe, you ſhall ſee boughes at the top correſpondently repreſented on the ground in the ſhaddow: ſo whatſoeuer curious work was ſeene in the roofe of this building, the ſame vnderneath was expreſt in the Floore.</p>

                     <p>Why? marry, firſt vnderſtand this reaſon, and then Ile ſhew you: You know euery Art both drawes it's imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from Nature, and labours to perfect it, which it does by finding comforts to preſerue it: Muſicke then at the firſt was found out as an antidote againſt griefe: and by this meanes, when men were grieued, they cried <hi>Oh,</hi> and there was one Note: then <hi>Hey-ho,</hi> there were two Notes more. So, when they laught, they obſeru'd three more by <hi>Ha, ha, ho.</hi> Theſe being firſt ioyn'd together, and afterwards variouſly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termixt, were the firſt harmonie in voice; which being repea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vnto grieued mindes, were as it were a prettie deluding of their ſorrowes; and theſe by obſeruation were afterwards reduc'd to inſtrument—</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Geog.</speaker>
                     <p>I conceit it, <hi>Muſica.</hi>

                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Muſ.</speaker>
                     <p>Thus, men perceiuing that theſe notes were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiu'd in the bellie, and afterwards, (as it were) form'd in the paſſage of the throat, ſowed Leather in the forme of a Bellie, or bagge; and wth a Reed made a long Necke vnto it, and a Winde-pipe; which when they blew full of winde, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiu'd it gaue no ſound, they cut many holes in the reed to let it out, and then alternately ſtopping the holes, they found an admirable varietie of harmony; and as the holes ſerue for diſtinction of notes in a Winde-inſtrument, ſo doe your frets on a String'd-inſtrument.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Geog.</speaker>
                     <p>Indeede I thinke this a truth; for as the voice was before the Inſtrument, ſo the Winde-inſtrument before the

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Muſ.</speaker>
                     <p>Why, on this manner: When <hi>Triton</hi> came to helpe the gods in the Warres of the Gyants, he wanted a weapon, and finding the ſhell of a Fiſh, he did blow in't, which yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded a moſt hideous noiſe: the Gyants thinking it had beene ſome terrible beaſt, fled away affrighted, and ſince by a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting imitation, men haue alter'd both the matter, and the forme of that Inſtrument.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Geog.</speaker>
                     <p>Nay, I do beleeue there is a great vertue in Muſicke.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Muſ.</speaker>
                     <p>O Sir, 'tis your onely medicine of the minde.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Geog.</speaker>
                     <p>Indeed I thinke ſo, and that's the reaſon, 'tis likely, why <hi>Apollo</hi> is the god both of Muſicke and Phyſicke: and now I remember it, in one place where we came, in our tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailes, there were no Phyſicions, but all their ſicke folks were cur'd by Muſicke; where was it, <hi>Phantaſtes?</hi> I haue quite for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Phant.</speaker>
                     <p>Why 'twas in <hi>Creet</hi> Sir, where <hi>Iupiter</hi> was nurs'd, and the Muſicke was made with thoſe Kettle-drums, which they ſounded to drowne the crying of <hi>Iupiter,</hi> when he was in his ſwathe-bands: in reward of which loue, hee procur'd of <hi>Apollo,</hi> in the fauour of the Cretians, that at the ſound of thoſe Kettle-drummes all ſicke folkes, whoſe time of death was not come, ſhould without any languiſhing ſicknes im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately recouer; and therefore the order is, when any one is ſicke, they carry him preſently in a Litter to the Temple where theſe Drums are kept; and if hee does not ſtraight-wayes recouer, they carry him home againe, as a man that muſt dye, and ſo prouide for his funerall.</p>

I haue indeede heard alſo of ſome of the <hi>Aſtronomias</hi> that haue beene belou'd by Poets; as by <hi>Manilius, Pontanus,</hi> and ſome other, who haue written whole Bookes in the praiſe of their beauties; but it ſeemes their beauties had ſuch ſmall diuinity in them, that they could not raiſe, to any height of poeticke rapture, the wits of their admirers. And there was alſo one <hi>Lucretius,</hi> a Romane Gentleman, in former times that fell in loue with <hi>Phyſica,</hi> ſhee from whom <hi>Phyſica</hi> the mother of <hi>Aſtronomia</hi> deriues now both her name and linage, which Gentleman, in the paſſion of his loue, writ books in the praiſe
<pb facs="tcp:4373:36"/>
of her beauty; but what wrinkle-fac'd Verſes they are, let the preſent age iudge; and if her beautie was like his lines, ſure ſhe was paſt her Three-ſcore, when hee fell in loue with her; but alas, there was neuer any of that family that euer came neere the <hi>Hiſtorias</hi> for beauty.</p>

iniurious, but mercifull; not for an ill-will to either, but a loue to both. Whileſt heretofore, I vnderſtood of this diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as I was ſomewhat caſt downe with ſorrow, ſo I was rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with an hope of happie reconcilement, but now that hope alſo which before was the cauſe of an vncertaine ioy, is become the ground of my moſt certaine griefe; and the rather to ſee the ſtate of our moſt bleſſed Commonwealth (which the gods haue decreed ſhall be eternall, if our ſelues hinder not) to be thus torne with our ciuill Diſcords. You are not igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of the miraculous meanes which the gods haue vs'd in rayſing vs to this greatneſſe: not by riches, but pouertie; not by plentie, but want; that what to others has beene the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of diſgrace, has to vs beene the meanes of our preſent honour: It is the obſeruation of the <hi>Grecians, Tacitus,</hi> and trueſt Oracle of <hi>Greece, Thucidides,</hi> that the <hi>Athenians</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth was not rays'd to that glorie (like the reſt of <hi>Greece</hi>) by the fruitfulneſſe but barrenneſſe of the ſoyle: for which cauſe whileſt the Inhabitants liu'd ſecure from the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaſion of Borderers, others growing rich, were at laſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſum'd by their owne diſſentions: ſo that for the auoyding of publike diſturbance, when any were afflicted, they retyred to the <hi>Athenians,</hi> with what they had left, before all were loſt; who as they did partake of the <hi>Athenians</hi> ſecuritie, ſo mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally offer'd to the <hi>Athenians</hi> the participation of their wealth: the like I may ſay of our preſent eſtate; we haue not ſought vnto others; yet who haue not ſought to vs? we had nothing, yet what want we, vnleſſe it be a moderation of our felicitie? All other Mechanicke faculties, of whatſoeuer Corporati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, haue they not forſooke themſelues to retyre to vs? and yeelded vp their eſtates, which they thought vnhappie, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue them as an happineſſe from our bountie? I ſpeake not theſe things vnto you as an inſtructer, but a remembrancer: Not to impoſe on you a new beliefe beyond your experience, but to imprint in your mindes a iuſt conſideration of your dangerous contention.

                     <p>Nay, <hi>Logicus,</hi> you haue little reaſon to ſay ſo, I can tel you: for if we take a view of the moſt illuſtrious Age, that euer the world inioy'd, which I thinke to be the time of the twelue <hi>Romane Caeſars;</hi> wherein Armes and Learning were at their height, you may obſerue Poetrie to haue beene moſt famous, embraced by Emperours, admired by all who laboured to haue their names amongſt the Learned. But for Logicians, alas, (I muſt ſpeake the truth) as their names were vnknowne, ſo were their endeuours buried in obſcuritie: Indeede thoſe times were thriftie, and actiue: but theſe, out of a wanton ſoftneſſe of a daintie ſloth, doe onely ſpinne out theſe Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-webs of curioſitie; and it hath beene often my meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to haue an amputation of ſuch Excreſcencies, and to cauſe that our youth which is to bee inſtructed for future vſe, ſhould not conſume the ſtrength of their wits, in an iniurious labour of fruitleſſe vanities. I doe not denie a iuſt knowledge of your facultie, to be moſt neceſſarie, and our ſelues there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>into haue an aduantage of former times: but yet, alas! how many thouſand famous Oratours haue there beene without Logicke? how many eternall Poets without Logicke? whoſe diuine eloquence could ſpeake beyond all Logicke; without all Logicke. <stage>

There was an <hi>Aſtronomia</hi> that I once had in cure before now, and ſhe was of the very ſame conſtitution, had the like diſeaſe, and the like turning in her head; now ſhe dyed, and afterward we made a diſſection in her head, to ſee what was the diſaffecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of her braine, which when we had done, we found all her braines turn'd to a matter much like cleere Ielly, or a Cryſtal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line Orbe: but I hope all ſuch ſuſpicions of this <hi>Astronomia</hi> are Fables—but ſtay—what's the relliſh of her vrine? <hi>(hee taſtes it)</hi>—Pah, naught, naught: oh, who would be a Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian to taſte theſe things?

                     <p>Why, Sir, in our North-voyage being come to the vtmoſt part in all <hi>Finmarchia,</hi> to the North-cape (the Longi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude thereof is well-nigh fiftie degrees, and the Latitude al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt 73.) being then paſt the Articke-circle about ſixe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, and ſo by conſequent being in a paralell Spheare, <hi>Geographus</hi> durſt not venture any further; and there was, Sir, at that time in our company, a great Magician (I haue forgot of what Vniuerſitie) which Magician and I, leauing <hi>Geogra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phus</hi> vpon the Land, vnder-tooke (being ſo neere) to diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the parts directly vnder the Pole.</p>

ſhip vpon the ice, and then the Magician being alſo an exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite Geometrician, got the ſhip vpon the Ice, and then made wheeles for it, and an artificiall Engine to make it goe of it ſelfe; you may ſee proportionally the like deuice in your Puppets that will goe and turne of themſelues. The ice then being ſmooth, the ſhip went forward of its owne accord, till wee found our ſelues to haue paſt the Articke circle twenty three degrees full. Then were we halfe a degree iuſt from the Pole: there we met with a moſt furious ſea, that ſcornes to yeeld to the vſurping cold; when the Geometrician takes me off the wheeles, and forth we lanched, and ſo ſail'd till wee came to haue the Pole it ſelfe for our Zenith; and then we beheld a dreadfull rocke.</p>

                     <p>Why thus, Sir: when the Magician ſaw this, he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately drawes a booke out of his Pocket, and falles to reading; when ſtraight-way all the ſea about vs was as calme as a freſh water riuer amongſt vs: and the ſhip went no faſter then we would haue it our ſelues; and ſo without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny danger we came to the rocke; vnto which making a ſhift to faſten our ſhippe, we aſcended: it ſeem'd as blacke as any Pitch: vpon the top of which (for we went to the top) there aſcended an huge Piller: which on the lower parts ſeem'd as blacke as the rocke; but ſtill in the Aſcent it grew whiter, and whiter; and indeed the whole piller ſeem'd to vs very Ice, but that it was at the lower part blacker, and it was as bigge as ordinarily any tower among vs; and at the bottome of it there was a paſſage to go in. We went in, and being entred, there were two paire of ſtaires, the one deſcending, the other aſcending: for we found the piller to be hollow, and our ſight could not diſcouer without-ſide how high it was: wee went downe wards ſome dozen or twenty ſtaires, where wee heard a moſt hideous noiſe, that our hearts failing vs we came vp againe.</p>

                     <p>No, Sir, we then went vpwards, and in our aſcent we ſtill found open places to giue vs light and Aire; as bigge commonly as a doore; and we aſcended ſo far, that at laſt the
<pb facs="tcp:4373:50"/>
Sunne ſhin'd vpon vs, as it does here, &amp; then it grieu'd vs to thinke we were to go backe ſuch an vncouth way againe; wel, we went ſtill higher, &amp; at laſt looking out at theſe doores, and ſeeing that part of the world that lay towards vs, (being a fine Sun-ſhine day,) we ſaw a very terrible battell, fought betweene the <hi>Turke</hi> and the <hi>Perſian,</hi> wherein the <hi>Turke</hi> was put to the worſt: but now the Magician growing weary, and deſirous to knowe how farre this Piller aſcended, he held by the ſide of the doore, and lookt vpwardes, but with the feare ſuddainely fell downe: and there was the vnhappy end of my companion. This piller doubtles we coniectur'd to be the Pole, and the way to heauen; and the ſtaires that deſcended, the way to hell, and to the other Pole. With this accident I being halfe affrighted, with a trembling at the wonders of the gods, humbly deſcended.</p>
